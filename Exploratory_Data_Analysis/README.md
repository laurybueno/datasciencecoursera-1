Course Project Assignment 1:

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/ ), a popular repository for machine learning datasets. 
In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which I have made available on the course web site:

-	Dataset: Electric power consumption [20Mb]
-	Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

1.	Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy 
2.	Time: time in format hh:mm:ss 
3.	Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) 
4.	Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) 
5.	Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) 
6.	Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) 
7.	Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). 
8.	Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
9.	Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

Plots: construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

- Plot 1: Histogram - Global Active Power / Frequency
- Plot 2: Plot - Day Time / Global Active Power
- Plot 3: Plot - Day Time / Energy sub metering
- Plot 4: 
		Plot 4.1: Plot - Day Time / Global Active Power
		Plot 4.2: Plot - Day Time / Voltage
		Plot 4.3: Plot - Day Time / Energy sub metering
		Plot 4.4: Plot - Day Time / Global Reactive Power
		

Plot Remarks: on some plot files, the day is in spanish (language on my PC)
