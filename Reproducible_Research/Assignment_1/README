README:

1. Data from a personal activity monitoring device. 

2. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day 

3. Intervals per Day: 24 x 60 / 5 = 288

4. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected
during the months of October and Nov-2012 and include the number of steps taken 
in 5 minute intervals each day.

5. Total Observations:          Oct <- 31 days
                                Nov <- 30 days
                                Total Observations: 61 x 24 x 60 / 5 = 17568

7. Variables / DataTables:
- stepMean1: dataset (DT)	 mean of the total number of steps taken per day without replacing 
 NA Values (31 obs. - 2 variables)
- stepMedia1: media of the total number of steps taken per day without replacing 
 NA Values
- stepMean2: dataset (DT1) mean of the total number of steps taken per day replacing NA Values
 with the mean per 5-minute interval (31 obs. - 2 variables).
- stepMedia2: media of the total number of steps taken per day replacing NA Values
with the mean per 5-minute interval.
- step_ave_interval: dataset with the mean per 5-minute interval.
- stepMeanDiff: dataset with the difference between stepMean2 - stepMean1, for definning the 
impact of replacing NA values (288 obs. - 2 variables)
- step_ave_act3: dataset without NA Values, per weekday / weekend day 
- naValuesIni: initial NA values in dataset (DT)
