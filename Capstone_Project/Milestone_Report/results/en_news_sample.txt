Diners can also get a grilled pork chop ($21), but Moniz forgoes the too-sweet elements that often accompany this cut for tart Meyer lemon marmalade, a small salad of mixed chicories and a gratin of artichoke and cardoon. It's an inspired blend that brings out the sweetness in the meat.
Ayala is joined in the kitchen by the lovely Yesinia Camacho, who is as excited as Ayala about introducing their native cuisine to new audiences.

Estevez accomplishes this by embracing the repetitive, ritualized essence of the pilgrimage itself. As lush landscapes and picturesque villages pass by on the screen, scene after scene after scene, the metaphor of life as a journey and a struggle begins to sink past the level of intellect. It's obvious, but it's still true, and when Tom and his motley compatriots reach the end of the road and each delivers a pithy summation, their exhausted satisfaction is contagious.
The conversation lasted no more than five minutes: Pritchett introduced himself, offered his badge and business card, and explained that although he typically focused on national security and terrorism, public corruption and white-collar crime were also Justice Department priorities.

Not necessarily challenges, just different ways to price a menu. It's a more family-oriented market, so we have to be sure we cater to families and children with a kids menu. I have a young daughter, too, so I'm happy when we go out and see a kids menu.
"Monster House" was shot with the same motion-capture process that was used in Mr. Zemeckis's "Polar Express," a process I didn't like then and don't like now, even though advancements have been made in its area of obvious weakness, immobile faces. "Monster House" benefits from strong graphic design and lovely lighting, but the script is nothing to write home about. It focuses on three neighborhood kids, reminiscent of the trio in "Harry Potter," who dare to penetrate the house in an effort to tame it. By the time they've survived a succession of standard-brand terrors done with visual flair, they understand what every homeowner already knows -- a house can eat you alive.

City officials and the visitor's bureau have been trying for decades to create an entertainment area to bring tax dollars and a sense of identity to the city. The closest they came was in the 1990s when a developer planned a Universal Studios-type project next to Great America, though it never came to fruition. They also courted the Oakland A's and San Francisco Giants for new ballparks, to no avail. But the city thinks it's finally reeled in its superstar.

Designers Charlie Groppetti and Todd Smith grew up in the country and have happy memories of their childhood homes and a simpler life. A nostalgic desire for the way things used to be led them in 2006 to start Park Hill Collection, a Little Rock company that designs vintage-inspired objects for your home. Some of their objects, such as salvaged sinks turned into planters, are playful. Others, such as reclaimed wood tables and mirrors, add period charm. Two years ago, the company added candles to its home accessories collection. Hand-poured in Arkansas, the soy-based candles ($22.50) are packaged in willow-wrapped glass -- ready to give. While Southern Charm is a top seller, other favorites include Sweet Tea, Front Porch and Farmhouse.

Blue cheeses must be difficult to perfect or our state's talented cheesemakers would surely make more of them. Sonoma County's Bellwether Farms experimented with the style, but never introduced a blue. No doubt Jones will continue to tweak Big Rock Blue - it's a newbie, after all - but it's impressive now.

This dazzling adaptation of Philip Pullman's fantasy novel proves that Oscar-winning visual effects aren't enough. By playing it safe and cutting the controversial anti-Christian elements, the producers disappointed the novel's fans. The sanitized story about a girl facing grown-up problems in a parallel world with talking animals might have scored with younger audiences, if not for the PG-13 rating. Will young Lyra Belacqua return in the planned sequel, "The Subtle Knife"? "Compass" cost $180 million and made $70 million. Do the math. 113 minutes. A two-disc version has tons of extras.

Shields won again, though he was far from his best. Despite posting a season high for strikeouts, his four walks also were a season high and the right-hander allowed a pair of homers for the second straight start.

Some - mostly those sneering from the outside - maintain that Cleveland fans have created a toxic environment for their teams by constantly bemoaning their fate. That the culture of losing and woe-is-me mentality feed off each other. That Cleveland fans would not know what to do with themselves if one of the major pro teams ever won the whole thing again.
Lobbyists and private contractors profit from this arms race. Hugely expensive projects like nuclear submarines and a new generation of bomber contribute more to defending the bottom line of major contractors than they do to defending America.

“ Some of the defendants did say things that perhaps they shouldn’t have said .. but they had a right to say it,” Weiss told the Free Press today, saying “it’s unfortunate that people are getting indicted” for speaking their minds. “It’s the thought police.

The savings rate was unchanged at 4.9 percent of after-tax incomes, the same as March. Both months represented the smallest savings rate since October 2008, the month the country was plunged into a deep financial crisis which contributed to the worst recession since the 1930s.

The margin was less than 10 points for only 90 seconds of the third quarter. Stoudemire went to the bench with his fifth foul with 6:41 left in the third, and Miami went on an 11-2 spurt not long after that all but sealed the outcome. It was 67-58 when Fields made two free throws with 4:49 left in the quarter - and then the Heat's "Big Three" needed just 3 minutes to blow the game open.

Secondhand smoke is smoke coming from another person or a burning cigarette (mainstream or side stream). It increases the risk of heart and blood vessel disease. Secondhand smoke is responsible for a large number of smoking-related deaths. The American Heart Association estimates that more than 35,000 nonsmokers die from heart disease caused by other people's tobacco smoke each year. This happens when people are exposed for long periods of time to secondhand smoke in homes or workplaces.
In the play, one of the conspiring reporters works for the Rocky Mountain News, though no evidence exists that the paper played any part in the scheme. But doing so allows Suh to exploit one of the longest newspaper rivalries in history, ending with the News' closure in 2009. You needn't have been alive in 1907 to know how intensely these papers feuded. But that year, Bonfils' enmity for News owner Thomas Patterson spilled out into the streets near the state Capitol. In the spirit of a Wild West duel, Bonfils attacked Patterson, who had called Bonfils a blackmailer in a News cartoon. When the teetering News was bought by Cincinnati media company Scripps-Howard and merged with The Express in 1926, Roy Howard spit, "We believe that a dictatorship of Denver's newspaper field by The Denver Post would be nothing less than a blight."

Our favorite yogurt recipe comes from David Lebovitz's "The Perfect Scoop": In a large bowl, stir together 3 cups Greek-style yogurt and 3/4 cup sugar until sugar is dissolved. You can vary the yogurt fat content, but at least 1 cup of whole-milk yogurt will help the texture. (Find Greek yogurt at Trader Joe's, Costco and Whole Foods Market.) Add a teaspoon of vanilla if you'd like. Omit it if you're after the Pinkberry taste. Chill mixture one hour, then freeze in an ice-cream maker according to your machine's instructions.

Brown's responses to the Sun-Times candidate questionnaire were brief. He "strongly opposes" SB512 because it might result in reduced pension benefits for current state workers, and he advocates allowing the temporary income tax increase to expire in 2014. Among his top priorities for the 27th District and for the state, Brown lists the creation of new job opportunities and job training, improved education for district children and increasing non tax-based revenue sources. All admirable goals, but Brown has not provided details about how he would make any of these changes.

Designers Charlie Groppetti and Todd Smith grew up in the country and have happy memories of their childhood homes and a simpler life. A nostalgic desire for the way things used to be led them in 2006 to start Park Hill Collection, a Little Rock company that designs vintage-inspired objects for your home. Some of their objects, such as salvaged sinks turned into planters, are playful. Others, such as reclaimed wood tables and mirrors, add period charm. Two years ago, the company added candles to its home accessories collection. Hand-poured in Arkansas, the soy-based candles ($22.50) are packaged in willow-wrapped glass -- ready to give. While Southern Charm is a top seller, other favorites include Sweet Tea, Front Porch and Farmhouse.

Desserts (all $7) provide slightly creative twists on many classics. Panna cotta tastes lightly of orange and comes with a creamy custard thinly spread underneath. It's OK, if a bit dense.

It was light, rich and good, especially with the ripe strawberries, but it wasn't zabaglione.

Desserts (all $7) provide slightly creative twists on many classics. Panna cotta tastes lightly of orange and comes with a creamy custard thinly spread underneath. It's OK, if a bit dense. When we ordered zabaglione, I expected a frothy, slightly boozy custard, which is usually made with eggs and Marsala, but instead got what tasted like tiramisu filling. It was light, rich and good, especially with the ripe strawberries, but it wasn't zabaglione.

All admirable goals, but Brown has not provided details about how he would make any of these changes.

Estevez accomplishes this by embracing the repetitive, ritualized essence of the pilgrimage itself. As lush landscapes and picturesque villages pass by on the screen, scene after scene after scene, the metaphor of life as a journey and a struggle begins to sink past the level of intellect.

He could be a regular for the Cardinals if Pujols' jumps town. He could be on the bench if Pujols returns. He could be traded if the right offer comes along and the Cardinals want to pounce on a starting shortstop, for example.
