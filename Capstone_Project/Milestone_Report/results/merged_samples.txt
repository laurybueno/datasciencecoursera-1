That's why more and more people are joining the Wall Street occupation. They can tell you about their homes being foreclosed upon, months of grinding unemployment or minimum-wage dead-end jobs, staggering student debt loads, or trying to live without decent healthcare. It's a whole generation of Americans with no prospects, but who are told to believe in a system that can only offer them Dancing With The Stars and pepper spray to the face.
Singer Dionne Warwick showed that the way to San Jose isn't the only thing she's not familiar with, as she pawed in bewilderment at the cash register. Actress and deaf person Marlee Matlin conveniently forgot a lifetime of lip-reading so she could have a sign-language interpreter serve as a go-between in case anyone was tempted to yell at her. Supermodel Niki Taylor tossed pizza dough into the air, actually catching it on the way down a few times.
I was lunching at Gaylords (still there, and still terrific) in Fitzrovia with two contacts, and we were one of just four tables occupied. Afterwards, I strolled round the restaurant-packed area and spoke to some owners. Two admitted they didn't think they'd make it through next year unless things looked up. All said their Christmas bookings were well down before around December 15th. What seemed to be depressing most of them was the total absence of any sign of improvement.
I've never owned a cat, but from what I've observed they do their thing and let you think you own them. They deign to grace you with their presence, and you're supposed to be grateful. And that obviously works for cats and their owners.
Billy slowly drove into Casey's driveway, and although she had been through a night of fear and terror, she felt nothing other than happiness and joy when she saw her house. It looked like heaven to Casey because she wasn't even sure if she would live to see daylight. Casey slung open the truck door and jumped out of Billy's truck in lightening speed. As she ran up to the driver's side and softly said "I know exactly what happened last night, Billy. You guys drugged me and raped me. And I will never forget it. You're going to get away with it because I am too ashamed to tell anyone what you guys did to me. You can bet your ass that God will avenge my honor. You may not go to jail, but you will suffer for what you did to me." Billy looked at her, and he was completely stunned that she remembered what had happened. This is probably due to, the fact that they gave her what they thought was a drug that would make her forget. Evidently, the effects weren't as potent as Billy had hoped.

Now, "making an example" of someone, to me, is the stuff of wartime prison camps. Not civil courts in peacetime. You cannot reasonably over-punish a high-visibility convict to deter those who might follow. Not fair. Nor, of course, could punishment by proxy be justified, supposing it were provable. Fact is, though, that a young man who clearly has some problems is being locked in with people who are more likely to supplement his trauma than to show him the way to enlightenment. And we are paying for it. I would say that the law is an ass. But I don't want to be in contempt of court, do I?
And so I began. I used the instructions I found online as my chief guide but after three days I was a little skeptical that the sour dough had fermented enough or produced enough yeast. My Twitter friend Finn said that he had been feeding his starter ("Veruca") for 12 days and it was now time. So I asked him if he thought my starter was ready? He confirmed what I thought and said no. So I've been letting "Finn Jr". grow and grow. Last night he became a rebellious teenager and we woke up to him trying to escape the safety of his jar to explore the world (thus the picture above this posting).
Today the kids cut or tore colorful tissue paper and glued them to their heart-shaped boxes ($0.99 each at my local craft store). I took them home today and Mod Podged them to seal and make them shiny...Tomorrow, the kids will pick out letters to spell M-O-M (or M-A-M-I or G-R-A-N-N-Y, depending on their own special person's name) from my collection of small foam letter stickers to decorate the top. They will also decorate a bag to 'wrap' it in. And voila, Happy Mother's Day! I think they'll be super cute when they're done.

So Shelly is the story of three friends, all modern-day high school students, based on the lives and personalities of the second generation of English Romantic poets: Gordon, Lord Byron; Percy Bysshe Shelley; and John Keats. After Shelly dies in what's ruled a "sailing accident," the other two steal the urn containing her ashes from her wake and attempt to fulfill her final wish to have them scattered on the very beach where her body washed ashore. In the process of completing their quest, Keats, as narrator, reveals the story of the trinity's pasts, together and apart.

The guru, or acaryadeva, as we learn from the bona fide scriptures, delivers the message of the absolute world, the transcendental abode of the Absolute Personality, where everything nondifferentially serves the Absolute Truth. We have heard so many times: mahajano yena gata sa pantha ("Traverse the trail which your previous acarya has passed"), but we have hardly tried to understand the real purport of this sloka. If we scrutinizingly study this proposition, we understand that the mahajana is one, and the royal road to the transcendental world is also one. In the Muaka Upaniad (1.2.12) it is said:
Maybe it's a problem with me, maybe I have no soul, but I don't hate animals. I've had pets. I've watched them lick their balls and I've cleaned up their period from the lino ("Oooh she's in season! How adorable!") and called them a cunt when they've farted on me and I've thought to myself that they have got a pretty good deal. If I could shit in the garden and get away with it I would. If I could fart in the back of someone's car and have everyone in stitches then I WOULD. But I can't. Because I'm not a dog. And a dog is not a fucking person.
There are experts who believe that taking even one drink may be endangering the health of the developing baby. One thing is clear, when an expectant mother has an alcoholic beverage- a beer, a glass of wine or a cocktail- her unborn child takes the same drink. It goes directly through her bloodstream and into the placenta.

This has led to legal repercussions on more than one occasion. Over the past few years, I've been following closely stories relating to the legal world, and there has been a surge of cases like this one in which jurors have caused mistrials or even been subjected to contempt of court for tweeting or blogging about their experiences in court.

But this movie is not made for people like me. It is made for a different demographic, which is fine. I knew it going in, but I had heard enough to suggest it would have, like, cross-subcultural appeal. It did not. I would almost rather watch a regular romcom/dramedy or whatever this was because at least it isn't trying to pretend it's all that different from the mainstream.

Though I'm sure it doesn't sound like it, I have gotten over quite a bit of my aggression and I've learned to forgive but I just simply won't forget. I realize the "what ifs" and regrets are pointless. I've even developed relationships with the people who hurt me and I'm able to look past what I consider to be their mistakes because in the end, regardless of what that one day meant, we are happy and no one can take that away from us.

It took all morning but we finally convinced Tali that she was two. She kept saying, "No!" but that her response to everything these days. ;) She didn't want to blow out the candles because she just wanted to dig into the cherry tomatoes. Those were the favorites and the first to disappear. Tali also ate the apples and sampled the cucumbers. Ana ate tomatoes, oranges, apples, cucumbers, and celery. She sampled the peppers. Amanda ate everything after arranging it all neatly on her plate. We didn't get to the pineapple so we'll try that at snack time.
I'm stealing a line from a song title today-the famous "Rainy Days and Mondays" by The Carpenters, 1971. Can't you just hear the tune in your head now? If you can, then I can assure you that it's probably going to be playing in there a long time! Or at least that's what happens to me when I am reminded of a song I like-the lyrics and music dance in my brain for hours at a time before fading away, often to appear again when I am trying to fall asleep in the middle of the night. Curses! My brother calls this phenomena 'ear worms'.an image I actually don't even like to think about!

As I was walking back to our hotel I decided to take a couple more pictures of the Alamo (I was without Jon and the kids). When I was taking the pictures someone asked if I wanted a picture in front of the Alamo. I'm hardly ever in a picture so I thought, sure...So here I am in front of the camera. (I'm realizing that I'm way to critical of myself in pictures. I just need to suck it up and get more pictures of me WITH my family instead of just taking pictures OF them. ...but that's another post...)
At about ten o'clock in the morning the sun threw a bright dust-laden bar through one of the side windows, and in and out of the beam flies shot like rushing stars.You don't usually read that kind of thing in a play. But there isn't a lot of it, and so the overall effect is streamlined and minimal- no philosophical rambling or wordy imagery. Big hearts for Steinbeck in this department. I want to read more novel-plays. (Recommendations please!)

I have recently become aware of a theory that suggests as we move closer towards 21st December 2012, Earth's timelines converge and we essentially get down to only two timelines. Timeline 1 which is positive and results in the New World/Golden Age and timeline 2 which results in the New World Order controlling this planet. We are apparently on timeline 1. Can the Nine shed any light on this theory?

But Tom Hiddleston. Man, is Tom Hiddleston good. He plays Loki the same way he played the character in Thor, not as a cartoon villain but as an at times sympathetic man torn between the way he regards his brother with both familial love and burning jealousy. There are scenes between Thor and Loki where you can almost see Loki willing to put an end to all of this, but too far in to stop now. Loki is not absolutely a villain, and none of the heroes are absolutely heroes. They all have doubts and moments of cynicism. It's what elevates the movie beyond merely a collection of character moments and an action-packed third act: the continuing thread about what the nature of heroism really is, where it comes from, and how it can be used to affect the world. It was there in Captain America: The First Avenger when Steve Rogers told Dr. Erskine "I don't want to kill anybody. I don't like bullies. I don't care where they're from." It was there when Thor learned how to wield his power for others and Tony Stark conquered his daddy issues.

Maybe Facebook should hire Thomas Friedman to do its ads. His ad for Coursera (h/t Indyanna's comment at Historiann's) column on online education pretty much explains why the 100,000-person online class and the flipped classroom, with local professors as glorified tutors, is the way to go. The comments are good, and they ask the same questions we've all been asking and come to some similar conclusions.
When the captain of your ship tells you to do something in a somewhat frenzied or stern voice, it's almost always for your own good and everyone else's, so you should just shut your mouth and do it. And not get defensive about it.

Charming landscaping. Flanked by a community mosque on one side and the Karachi residence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi on the other, Hilal Park stretches over a hillock. The landscape design, which makes exceptional use of the topography, is the highlight of the Park. A brick path, edged with immaculately pruned topiaries weaves through well-maintained, exotically shaped flower beds, up a hill, and over culverts and wooden bridges that span over the narrow ravines in the rock formations.

It was a grade ten class (or the tenth grade as they say down south, a form which always causes me to imagine the voice of James Earl Jones), mostly constituted with boys. Although teenage males can be (ahem - pun warning) boysterous, it was a pretty good class. It was a group that could easily have gotten out of hand, but somehow, we found a way to co-exist, and it actually turned out to be quite a good class.
Despite the horrid waste of taxpayer's money on the various green energy firms that keep failing, Obama blamed the Solyndra debacle on the Chinese who "were subsidizing their solar industry and flooding the market in ways that Solyndra couldn't compete." That was well known before the Solyndra half billion dollar loan guarantee was made, followed by still more to other solar companies.

Most long time readers of short stories consider either Trevor or Alice Munto (Canada) as the best world wide of contemporary short story writers. Trevor (1928-Mitchelstown, County Cork, Ireland) is a very prolific writer. In addition to numerous novel, he has written 100s of short stories. The Collected Short Stories of William Trevor is 1280 pages. I first encountered Trevor this week and will just comment briefly on the two stories (both published in The New Yorker) I read.

Besides, isn't state-ism itself a religion for most Americans? Do they not honor the state above all else, above even the commandments of a conventional religion they may embrace? If their religion tells them "thou shalt not murder," but the state orders them to murder, then they murder. If the state tells them to rob, to destroy property, and to imprison innocent people, then, notwithstanding any religious strictures, they rob, destroy property, and imprison innocent people, as millions of victims of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and millions of victims of the so-called Drug War in this country will attest. Moreover, in every form of adversity, Americans look to the state for their personal salvation, just as before the twentieth century their ancestors looked to Divine Providence.
  
Let's examine the second half of the video. One protester calls out 'Mic check!,' and everyone knows what this means. This guy will speak for us, he has something to say. And if they disagree, they can simply stop passing this person's words along. But in this case he speaks words of de-escalation. We will let you police leave. He's teaching the police a lesson in non-violence. It's amazing to see this at work.

He also sought to break from the class-conscious conventions of the 1930s and early 40s, when top hat and tails or tuxedos were the norm, by dancing in casual or everyday work clothes, so as to make his dancing more relevant to the cinema-going public. As his first wife, actress and dancer Betsy Blair explained: "A sailor suit or his white socks and loafers, or the T-shirts on his muscular torso, gave everyone the feeling that he was a regular guy, and perhaps they too could express love and joy by dancing in the street or stomping through puddles.he democratized the dance in movies."[14] In particular, he wanted to create a completely different image from that associated with Fred Astaire, not least because he believed his physique didn't suit such refined elegance: "I used to envy his cool aristocratic style, so intimate and contained. Fred wears top hat and tails to the manner born - I put them on and look like a truck driver."[2]

After compiling a passel of such non-animation and not exclusively cartoon images, I have decided to launch them on their own blog: "Pacific SplendorLAnd", where they will not interfere with the winnowing but still vaguely animation-related ramblings here.The main thing I have enjoyed about doing these pieces is that they wind up being singular, self-contained compositions, as opposed to quick fragmented doodles on the one end of the spectrum; or artwork created as a stream of storytelling devices, such as a storyboard or an animation sequence on the other. So somehow this makes them want their own blog.

When we allow ourselves to let go of wanting the other to fill us up, when we let ourselves be real, as we are, another energy comes through our body and being. It will charge our entire being with a presence, a force that is absolutely free of wanting. We feel open, grounded, free, humble and powerful - zero and everything. It is as through our body, heart and soul simultaneously flower in reverential awe of the moment. This force is an exquisite expression of the flower of life itself.
In five stories, Christie allows the murderer to escape justice (and in the case of the last three, implicitly almost approves of their crimes); these are The Witness for the Prosecution, The Man in the Brown Suit, Murder on the Orient Express, Curtain and The Unexpected Guest. (When Christie adapted Witness into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed.) There are also numerous instances where the killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but instead dies (death usually being presented as a more 'sympathetic' outcome), for example Peril at End House, Death on the Nile, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Crooked House, Appointment with Death, The Hollow, and Secret Adversary. In some cases this is with the collusion of the detective involved. Five Little Pigs, and arguably Ordeal by Innocence, end with the question of whether formal justice will be done unresolved.

That the lives of these old fellows we see on television, and whose names we now know, go back more than a century, touches us - and it may add to the power they project for us that they are not especially heroic and do not represent themselves that way. That they do not posture or make use of any of the rhetorical cliches, but are modest survivors of the ordinary circumstances and perils of living. And that on television, where glamorisation is almost a given, so that any claim they might once have had to youthful beauty is simply irrelevant. Very young people, I suspect, who find themselves living in a dangerous and chaotic world, and with their own lives fearfully before them, feel a special affection for these old fellows who have indestructibily battled through - and even a small sense of reassurance ...

The race organisers couldn't help the weather, but there was a lot throughout the day which showed that given the warning they had about the likelihood of poor weather, they could have performed a whole heap better than they did. This became abundantly clear from the start as only one entrance to the stadium was open though two were advertised in the programme - this meant all runners trying to get in and out through one gate. Pandemonium. At about this time - still with half an hour to go - organisers were trying to chivee everyone out of the stadium to start lining up at the start in the cold and wet.

There was a problem with Shirley's printer which held up the order slightly and so she was extremely kind and sent me this other Love design as a special surprise, and it's now brightening up the side of my wardrobe. As mentioned before I do not like the wardrobes in my bedroom and they desperately need painting cream but now I see this pretty print instead of the wood and I just adore it. (Sorry for the reflections in the glass!)
I know that she loves and adores me.I love all you gals too.

Our personal psychology is how our karmic patterns show up in this lifetime. A general Buddhist or Hindu perspective on karma suggests that the individual soul moves through consciousness lifetime after lifetime, incarnating again and again in the school of life in order to complete various tasks and lessons, and to release contractions of consciousness.

I really wanted to give the quilter the ability to use their stash but also allow them to go shopping. Who wouldn't want to have some of the newest cutest fabrics in their scrap quilt? It was VERY HARD for me to STOP buying fabric. I kept telling myself, "Ooooh! Wouldn't this be cute? I have to have a bit of this!" I actually used over 150+ fabrics in this quilt. I hope you have fun playing with your stash and adding the newest cutest fabrics to your quilt.

Luke 1:76-79
Ann, or perhaps Jo, said that one impressive thing about the novel was the way that early on we are led to see the Garners as unusually philanthropic slave owners, but later realize that this is just a matter of relativity, and that they have their own cruelties. I said that one of the most horrifying moments for me, though, was not the out-and-out cruelty from which it's easy to distance oneself, but the incident towards the end when Sethe's living daughter Denver goes to the abolitionists' house to ask for work. Here she comes across something which horrifies her: a small statue of a black child with its head pulled back and its lower lip extended to receive coins casually thrown down, ready for paying tradesmen - a figure so like the Little-Black-Sambo collection figures that stood unremarked outside shops and in arcades in my own childhood, that I was pushed up suddenly against my own unconscious collusion in racism.

Had the jury been told that Vincent Tabak used pornography which involved ".images of men holding their hands around women's necks during sex and photos of women tied up in car boots", then asked to decide if he intended to kill, it is difficult to see how that fact could fail to colour their thinking.
~ Confidence in my ability as an intuitive person.
I have read through the Internet and came out with some conclusions. Firstly, all films are manipulative on some level but the way they handle it is how you distinguish whether they are subtle or heavy-handed. Now these two words are pretty ambiguous and they are rather the absolute so I think it is safe to say that no film is fully subtle or no film is fully heavy-handed. In fact, a lot of films, good or bad, is a mix and mash of both and it can be quite indiscernible most of the time. There are, however, films and cartoons that lean heavily towards each spectrum and I will try to give some examples below.

Sure, the sets are overlit (every frame of Season 24 was overlit - why change things for this story?). Yes, the cliffhanger gag at the end of episode one is not just ghastly, but one of the dumbest moments ever, in all of Doctor Who. True, the bulk of the Iceworld sets are never even remotely convincing, not for a second (though Kane's lair is effective enough). The less said about the appearance of the "Dragon," the better. And I will never in a million years understand what they were going for with the C-subplot of that irritating little girl and her mother, a strand which fails on every level, but especially at being cute. Melanie. Yep, "Dragonfire" has its fair share of McCoy-era fuck-ups, and yet they somehow never really overpower the stronger aspects of the story.

The guru, or acaryadeva, as we learn from the bona fide scriptures, delivers the message of the absolute world, the transcendental abode of the Absolute Personality, where everything nondifferentially serves the Absolute Truth. We have heard so many times: mahajano yena gata sa pantha ("Traverse the trail which your previous acarya has passed"), but we have hardly tried to understand the real purport of this sloka. If we scrutinizingly study this proposition, we understand that the mahajana is one, and the royal road to the transcendental world is also one. In the Muaka Upaniad (1.2.12) it is said:
That the lives of these old fellows we see on television, and whose names we now know, go back more than a century, touches us - and it may add to the power they project for us that they are not especially heroic and do not represent themselves that way. That they do not posture or make use of any of the rhetorical cliches, but are modest survivors of the ordinary circumstances and perils of living. And that on television, where glamorisation is almost a given, so that any claim they might once have had to youthful beauty is simply irrelevant. Very young people, I suspect, who find themselves living in a dangerous and chaotic world, and with their own lives fearfully before them, feel a special affection for these old fellows who have indestructibily battled through - and even a small sense of reassurance ...

As stated in his book "The Leadership Engine", Tichy Noel reinforces that learning is a key requirement for developing leadership. We enhance our unique qualities through learning and education. Studying abroad was probably one of the richest experiences of my life. It was a privilege to study for my MBA at Duke, The Fuqua School of Business. It was a unique moment of my life. The globally focused education allowed me to make a deep personal assessment while providing me with an actionable set of global leadership tools. (Not to mention that I met my wife during my MBA, this is awesome).

All edges were coloured with Memento green dye ink applied with cut'n'dry foam. The bottom panels were first trimmed out of Kraft card and then matted with the pink paper.and stuck in place as shown. The main panel on the plaque was put together similarly but before attaching was stamped with a moth stamp (PaperArtsy) in Archival black ink and embellished with a diecut (Nestabilities) tag with pink panel and another 'Smile' stamp (PaperArtsy). The roses were applied at the base on foam pads. A piece of 3 mm dark green satin ribbon was tied through the hole in the tag and a piece of black numbers Washi tape applied before sticking in place.
I went to the front desk and explained what happened and luckily they did give us a room (it would have been a long trip home!). We got the same type of room, same rate, but it was a handicapped accessible room. They probably hold those rooms back in case they are needed. I don't know yet if I got charged for our missed night. I had reserved the room with a card that I subsequently canceled (due to fraud). So I don't know if they would have been able to charge it or not.
I was pleasantly surprised to find the quality of items such as fruits and meat to be just what I would have picked. The bananas aren't too ripe and the clementines look fine. I got everything on my order and there were no surprises, since the website offers 3-D close ups of all things you buy, so I knew which brands and how much of everything I was getting.
Visiting Varenna will take you along another historical route. This pilgrimage trail leads uphill to the spectacular Varenna Castle.

She kept saying, "No!" but that her response to everything these days. ;) She didn't want to blow out the candles because she just wanted to dig into the cherry tomatoes. Those were the favorites and the first to disappear. Tali also ate the apples and sampled the cucumbers. Ana ate tomatoes, oranges, apples, cucumbers, and celery. She sampled the peppers. Amanda ate everything after arranging it all neatly on her plate. We didn't get to the pineapple so we'll try that at snack time.
The ideas employed in foul play are given a false foundation but one that is seemingly real. They depend on the person to whom they present the ideas to mistake the reality. Thus the targeted person believes their somatic reactivity is evidence that the idea is real. And this is generally true. If we sense danger for instance, even though we don't have sensory information our body will move to fear because that is natural. It is the preparation of our body to face and deal with the danger. In foul play the danger card is play to cause the targeted person to mistakenly believe that the presented idea, of which they are more conscious, has led to their somatic arousal. This empowers the ideas. In reality the danger posed and the idea presented are unrelated. It is through trickery that the person targeted is brought along to believing in the ideas presented. And you will see that with certainty when you are no longer unsuspecting of the foul play having done the experiments and having seen how easily you can be manipulated while believing the medical misinformation. And that includes the psychiatric babble about misreading others if you are suspicious. What they are effectively saying is that you have to accept appearances at face value. That's self-serving garbage. When you have done the experiments and "wised up" or "level up" to use PC game parlance, then the foul game can't be played as to obtain a result. You can "walk through the valley of the shadow of death and fear no evil"! A knowledgeable person can stand against the evil mobs and win. I am living proof of that but you need to see that for yourselves. It is good for you to be sceptical of what I am presenting but please also be curious. This is not about some academic pursuit; this is a life and death matter. To be empowered and reap the benefits for yourselves you must realize the truth and not just know it.

Those who see the injustice of the CDF's attempt to suppress LCWR need to respond with similar courage. Now is not the time to be afraid, worried, or despairing. We must rely on our God who promised to be with us and guide us in our times of need. The only thing we can ever change is ourselves and our responses, not other people or situations. We have the choice at this juncture to respond with courage.

So end our readers' tributes to Hitch. As I expect many of you have been doing, I've spent quite a few hours over the last two weeks watching videos of Christopher in debate, giving talks, or taking down pompous talking heads on television. I could recommend my favorites, but suggest instead that you just find a random one and follow the YouTube links. You will be impressed: for someone who talked so often, he rarely repeated himself, and everything he said sounded fresh. We have nobody to replace this man, but, thank Ceiling Cat, he left us a legacy of not only his writings and the example of his courage, but also the visual record of his eloquence and incessant fight for the truth.

Step 2 - Drop and Bake: Drop batter by tablespoon onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in a well pre-heated 350º F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Do not over-bake. Cookies should be a bit gooey in the center. While warm, they will be very soft on the outside, as well. Allow them to cool on the pan a few minutes and then transfer carefully to a rack to finish cooling. (They will always be somewhat soft because these are gooey fudge brownie cookies, not hard or crunchy cookies.)

The point here is surely not to deride empiricism. Heaven knows conservatism could stand to quit leading with its heart and start thinking more empirically about the world as it is, not the world as they wish it to be. The point, if I'm reading them correctly, is that too many leading voices on the left give themselves over to wonkiness, and presume that their moral convictions are widely shared, such that the only reason anybody could disagree with them is through ignorance (willful or not), or malice.

The first instant of cold as he embraced Clearsight was welcome, refreshing, numbing to the anxiety of being so far in conflict with the Wildren. It didn't last; the cold sharpened, pushed hard fingers through the centre of his forehead, and pain returned. At least he stayed distracted from worrying about Dora and Taslin. Even without the pressure between his eyes, the room revealed by his enhanced vision made sure of that.

I don't know.maybe nobody else feels like this about indie publishing. But this is sort of where I think I am with it. It's wonderful on so many levels - but its big flaw, I think, is that it's just too easy. Too easy to implement.too easy to mess up.too easy to get discouraged (because your frame of reference when you're solo is really quite small). Too easy, essentially, to jump in when you're green and flounder around.because you're green.

Even more importantly I think I'm having a rebirth of my spirit. For the longest time I've basically just existed. I've done the bare minimum around the house. It's been a struggle to get that done too. But the last few weeks I've been WANTING to spread my wings and take the time to make the homemade breads and the homemade snacks. I've been wanting to do that stuff. It's almost like I'm being reborn. I don't know what has brought this about. I'm afraid to blink...afraid that it will go away if I do. I still have all the stress and depression in my life....but I'm really trying to not let it affect ME. And maybe that's the whole difference.
You do not win public backing for an argument about pensions by inconveniencing your parents.
WEALTHY FAMILIES: The first is wealthy families where the older generation has retired or is nearing retirement. Typically, their income is secure and they're concerned primarily with wealth protection and transfer. Agents may find that these wealthy families can take underutilized or under-performing assets and convert them to a permanent life insurance policy, often with the added advantage of a LTC rider. This strategy helps secure their wealth and makes it possible to pass on their assets to heirs in a tax-advantaged way, as well as assuring their long-term security if they need care.

Yesterday I did pretty well in the food dept. My usual bagel and cream cheese for breakfast (though I really do need to go get my weight watchers bagels instead of the big white ones I have now), honeydew and cantaloupe for lunch, a small wrap with about 1/8 cup chicken and the rest peppers and onions for supper and some more honeydew for a bedtime snack. Normally I wouldn't have a bedtime snack cause I tend to just mindlessly eat, but this was a planned snack with a set portion and I didn't even want to mindlessly eat afterwards!

Given NuLabour's visceral hatred and contempt for the white working class, who's interests so often conflicts with those now much preferred groups, many observers would have assumed that Denham was either making a bad joke and had forgotten the punchline, or was suffering from some catastrophic mental breakdown, had they, that is, not realised that an election is imminent.
Under both systems, sacrifice is invoked as a magic, omnipotent solution in any crisis-and "the public good" is the altar on which victims are immolated. But there are stylistic differences of emphasis. The socialist-communist axis keeps promising to achieve abundance, material comfort and security for its victims, in some indeterminate future. The fascist-Nazi axis scorns material comfort and security, and keeps extolling some undefined sort of spiritual duty, service and conquest. The socialist-communist axis offers its victims an alleged social ideal. The fascist-Nazi axis offers nothing but loose talk about some unspecified form of racial or national "greatness." The socialist-communist axis proclaims some grandiose economic plan, which keeps receding year by year. The fascist-Nazi axis merely extols leadership-leadership without purpose, program or direction-and power for power's sake.

I love that Turtle, really I do.
On the one hand, it absolutely deserves an five-star review for its sheer audacity, innovation, and mastery of language. This is a very clever, beautifully written novel that manages to deliberately meander without boring the reader. It's also a very humorous novel, not so much in a laugh-out-loud sort of way, but one which succeeds in delivering a smile (or more often a smirk) per page. When I allowed myself to become lost in Arno's voice, I quite enjoyed the read, even as I rolled my eyes and scoffed at his good-natured laziness. It's no wonder Baker gets far more attention as a purveyor of literature than as a genre author, but you get the sense that's entirely how he likes it.

Can you tell from my reviews recently that it is getting colder outside? I truly love this time of year for beer. Don't get me wrong I love a good APA or IPA in the summer, but even more I enjoy a fine stout or porter during the colder months of the year.

He would not have been hurt if he went over but he might have scared himself.

Perhaps it's no surprise then that the Mirror Pool has suddenly become my favourite place in the city. It's a sign of all that God's promised for Bradford is, in fact, coming. The wells of the Spirit are, in fact, now open. The curse IS lifted and Bradford IS free, she just doesn't realise it and so lives as if it isn't. But 'there is a time coming, and is now here', when Bradford will begin to realise that she IS loved by this Father who gave everything for her, even Jesus, and gives His Spirit without measure, and that she DOES have a future. This city is NOT what the media and some of her people paint her to be.

I used to sell property and casualty insurance down in Sarasota Florida. I remember after I got licensed I was supposed to find a target niche for my prospecting efforts and develop a marketing strategy to target businesses within that niche. I picked professional liability after some quick success in that line of business and put together a prospect list of companies who I wanted to approach about writing their insurance. There was one account that I set my eyes on and really wanted to land. It was a large multi location diagnostics facility with large property and casualty exposures that would not only result in a challenge to structure but would land me a huge commission if I could write the account.

Seems to be the case that for some reason, the Left (as I'll call them here), have been brainwashed into thinking the EDL are a violent Nazi group. My experience is that it's the UAF that are against free speech, human rights and are willing to let this country go to the dogs!

This 'raw-footage' interview was uploaded on Pat Farenga's you tube channel and I just thought it provided such a nice overview of Holt and his ideas on education. Here's just one juicy quote:
This studio is now gone, and nobody will ever record in it again. It was Sandro's house for a long time. Over ten years I believe. And he was always paying rent, and, after he turned it into a studio, the owner would not sell the house to him without trying to rip him off. Now it is part of a history that involved a lot of people, a lot of music, a lot of concentration and dedication - a history that has moved into other places and other songs, that can't be stopped but which remains alive thanks to recording and sharing technologies.
If a payment remains overdue for a set period, such as 60 or 90 days, the licensor will usually have the right to terminate the agreement without resort to arbitration. In some countries, this does not apply if the overdue payment is caused by a temporary banking or government problem.
As someone with Type 1 diabetes (the "real" diabetes, as I like to put it -- the kind you can't help getting), I sometimes wonder when I'll end up retiring, or how long I can escape death. So I wonder how much I should be saving for retirement. Will I get the typical 25-30 year long retirement? Or would I have to retire at 40 to pull that one off? If I work until I'm 65, I could have lots put away, only to die within 2 years if I'm lucky, on the other hand.
Another website says that "as a result, many people nowadays suffer from the over-acidification of their body, also known as acidosis." In addition, they claim that "symptoms of a pH imbalance can be weight problems such as overweight and underweight, as well as other health conditions such as allergies, arthritis, acne and heart attacks."
They see no way out. And so they resort to the same, short-sighted tactic that has doomed so many great civilizations in history: They devalue their currency - a quick-and-handy device to confiscate wealth from their own people.
Then as the conversation wasn't really going to settle anywhere and it was already getting late, I just moved them on to starting to prep the weeks passage. Esther said, we need to talk. So they went into doing personal time with the text and we talked in someone's room. She was visibly distraught and shared her heart that she was upset in the unbelief that had been coming out in our discussion of what to do about large group. At first I was a little taken aback but as she shared her heart and I reflected back on the conversation, I could see that she was right. We had but Jesus back into a box declaring for him what he could/couldnt do in and through our new people hours after having taken him our of the box at fall con. I felt convicted of my own desire to appease people and unbelief of how Jesus could work at UCI. So we came back together with our leaders and Esther shared her heart, her Holy discontent at what had just transpired and it led to a time of repentance from all of our leaders. That would have been cool enough but in the midst of that time, Jesus ministered to the leader I had prayed with at Fall Con by calling out some of the lies he believed about himself being the weak link in the group as we all affirmed him. It was a beautiful moment of the Holy Spirit doing what was on its agenda, not ours. Please pray that we continue to be open to the interruption of the Spirit.

I guess I'll start with the name in the address bar. For a while now (at least ten years) I've been working on a fantasy series that has recently become more serious to me. One of the main plot devices is a dream world. So, when I went to use the restroom at a truckstop one day and saw this written on the inside of one of the stalls in permanent marker, I knew I had to incorporate it into my story. Now I have a character who manufactures dreams and I am one step closer to getting this story off the ground.

Have you noticed a difference in people's attitudes toward religious and spiritual expression between rural and urban communities?
Teaching, because I'm a teacher. Writing, because most writers have to rant about the process at one point or another. Food, because, I like to eat, cook and have plenty of opinions about restaurants. Movies and theater and museums. My family.

Under both systems, sacrifice is invoked as a magic, omnipotent solution in any crisis-and "the public good" is the altar on which victims are immolated. But there are stylistic differences of emphasis. The socialist-communist axis keeps promising to achieve abundance, material comfort and security for its victims, in some indeterminate future. The fascist-Nazi axis scorns material comfort and security, and keeps extolling some undefined sort of spiritual duty, service and conquest. The socialist-communist axis offers its victims an alleged social ideal. The fascist-Nazi axis offers nothing but loose talk about some unspecified form of racial or national "greatness." The socialist-communist axis proclaims some grandiose economic plan, which keeps receding year by year. The fascist-Nazi axis merely extols leadership-leadership without purpose, program or direction-and power for power's sake.

The tan color deepened to brown and spread around me. To my astonishment, the area of color developed, like a photo, into a vision of a man with chocolate-brown skin. He superimposed himself over the left side of my face and upper chest and my left arm, and I perceived him as if from the inside and the outside at the same time. I could actually see him, with technicolor clarity, something that had never, ever happened to me before. He looked to be in his mid-thirties, with very round cheeks and prominent eyes, a little like Louis Armstrong. I heard the name "Bertram."

I went to the front desk and explained what happened and luckily they did give us a room (it would have been a long trip home!). We got the same type of room, same rate, but it was a handicapped accessible room. They probably hold those rooms back in case they are needed. I don't know yet if I got charged for our missed night. I had reserved the room with a card that I subsequently canceled (due to fraud). So I don't know if they would have been able to charge it or not.
I had never seen so many hippies in one place outside Central Park. We were all over the grounds and buildings, setting up tents and campsites outdoors and inside, utilizing the communal kitchen, and playing together everywhere. Perhaps what amazed me most during that week was how careful we were to keep the place clean, how nothing was trashed or damaged, how all of us were committed to leaving the grounds as we'd found them or even better.
I still believe in the standard of care that most midwives provide for low-risk, uncomplicated pregnancies and births. I do believe that when I started bleeding at 15 weeks, the midwife should have bowed out of my care. I do believe that when I was sure my water broke at 18 weeks, she should have bowed out of my care. I don't blame midwives in general. I'm not even sure I blame her specifically. I should have spoken up. I should have insisted on an ultrasound. I should have asked for a second opinion. I didn't. At the least, we share blame. At the most, as his mother, the blame falls on me for not protecting him.

In the end, we got everything cleaned out and they apartments offered them a new apartment since the condition of the carpet, walls, and just everything in general was in such deplorable condition. I also told them that I wouldn't help them a second time. I don't think I could handle doing something like that more than once. I even refurnished their new place since all their furniture was ruined. T.V., couch, tables and chairs, beds, dressers, etc. I found all of it for them.

But going down through the water to touch the wild man at the bottom of the pond is quite a different matter. The being who stands up is frightening, and he seems even more so now, when corporations do so much work to produce the sanitized, hairless shallow man (2) That's poor Viggo in THE ROAD, a sanitized man re-bearded, trying to be wild in a wild land, having to re-learn the role of the deep, dark masculine and getting it incorrect. No reflection on Viggo, of course, who showed he can bring that shit hardcore in the RINGS films and HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. It's more I think the head-on craftsmanshippy approach to the McCarthy novel -- it gets it too right, maybe, to work.

Here it is. The real purpose of the visit to Pho 68. Pho with rare beef and braised beef. It looked the part, and tasted it too. They've got the makings of a really good pho here. The stock was excellent. Deep, aromatic and intensely savoury. Wafer thin slices of beef were rare on arrival but cooked through as time progressed, the gentle poaching keeping them tender. The braised beef (brisket I think) was also sliced thin, but had a stronger, minerally flavour. The tendon running through it was soft and gelatinous speaking of long, slow cooking. The noodles, save for a little gluey clump at the top, were cooked just right.

The five soups/stews in my rotation for Souper Sundays (the adorable name I use for making a massive amount of food before the work week) are: chicken vegetable, mushroom barley, hambone, roasted vegetable, and chili.

Also, I didn't want to do two WCIC posts back to back so this was the only alternative.
Roger Webster, who gives a rather simplistic view of the historical facts in his bedside book - "The Illustrated at the Fireside - Pg 56", gives some insight into how it came about that the British press of that time managed to frame Hermanus Potgieter as a rogue and a villain. At that time the Volksraad of the Transvaal had passed a law prohibiting barter with the local people, under a penalty of £37.10. The object of the law ---- now listen carefully, ---- was to keep the peace! The fact that someone was going to make lots of money was beside the point!

One thing I have noticed after watching a number of these space shows is that unless you're watching a live feed from the space station, nobody can make a space show about ANY planet or moon without mentioning and showing digitally rendered footage, at least four times in an hour-long show, of a huge asteroid hitting the Earth and wiping out our entire existence. They're obsessed. Though I feel that the obsession probably has more to do with sensationalism to boost ratings than an obsession with the end of the world as we know it. The way they work that scenario into every show smacks of the sensationalism used to get people to watch the news every night. Jackasses.

The ideas employed in foul play are given a false foundation but one that is seemingly real. They depend on the person to whom they present the ideas to mistake the reality. Thus the targeted person believes their somatic reactivity is evidence that the idea is real. And this is generally true. If we sense danger for instance, even though we don't have sensory information our body will move to fear because that is natural. It is the preparation of our body to face and deal with the danger. In foul play the danger card is play to cause the targeted person to mistakenly believe that the presented idea, of which they are more conscious, has led to their somatic arousal. This empowers the ideas. In reality the danger posed and the idea presented are unrelated. It is through trickery that the person targeted is brought along to believing in the ideas presented. And you will see that with certainty when you are no longer unsuspecting of the foul play having done the experiments and having seen how easily you can be manipulated while believing the medical misinformation. And that includes the psychiatric babble about misreading others if you are suspicious. What they are effectively saying is that you have to accept appearances at face value. That's self-serving garbage. When you have done the experiments and "wised up" or "level up" to use PC game parlance, then the foul game can't be played as to obtain a result. You can "walk through the valley of the shadow of death and fear no evil"! A knowledgeable person can stand against the evil mobs and win. I am living proof of that but you need to see that for yourselves. It is good for you to be sceptical of what I am presenting but please also be curious. This is not about some academic pursuit; this is a life and death matter. To be empowered and reap the benefits for yourselves you must realize the truth and not just know it.

I kissed them all over their faces and told them I loved them and we would see them again, and help them in the meantime. Isabelle and Johnny begged to give them all the food we had in the van, so we asked them to walk back with us. We walked down that path to the van, praying the whole way. I didn't know until later that night after looking at the pictures that we were all holding hands. Isabelle and Johnny love these girls too, and their hearts were broken and changed that day too.

We all know our mistakes and we're well aware of all the obvious ways we mess up and keep messing up. It's also one of the many reasons, we avoid God.

There were times where I was frustrated to tears--and a bloody nose-- giving up and threading my way to freedom with my hands outstretched to prevent further injury. Since those days, I have seen halls of mirrors in traveling carnivals, but none were as large and complicated as P.O.P.'s. None had the distracting, dizzying lights that lent a sense of spaciousness and multiplied like a field of supernovas against the glass. Once inside, you banged endlessly against your likenesses, trapped in a world of a thousand yous!
Now that a few days have passed, I look back on that Chrysalis weekend with such joy. I don't think about the logistics of it all, I think about how present God was throughout it. With God's help, that weekend was flawless. And as I sat on Sunday listening to these girls talk about how positively affected they were by this weekend.. I knew at that very instant that every bit of sweat and tears was worth it.
If you buy into the idea of an economic collapse that allows some sort of plausible, individualistic retreat scenario, you are probably also going to like Crawford's EMP scenarios, even if the most obvious EMP scenarios would normally include enough regular style nukes to melt the planet.
But this movie is not made for people like me. It is made for a different demographic, which is fine. I knew it going in, but I had heard enough to suggest it would have, like, cross-subcultural appeal. It did not. I would almost rather watch a regular romcom/dramedy or whatever this was because at least it isn't trying to pretend it's all that different from the mainstream.
Personally, I am a fan of books like this that help bridge the gap to help children graduate from reading Bible picture books to actually digesting Scripture. And while it is not a homeschool "curriculum", it would certainly adapt well as a Bible curriculum, especially if your family enjoys the New Living Translation. On the other hand, children this age are incredibly impressionable. They are thinking and absorbing so much. It is time to sharpen up on your theology. I have read some Bible storybooks where the stories are retold in a way that uses soft theology or even sways the story by adding (or omitting) details to the original text. The mere fact that someone picks and chooses only certain Bible stories to retell means that the person has at least some control of what the final presentation looks like. In this book, Carolyn Larsen has condensed the Scripture to retell each story, but (as you can see from the one example above) she is merely eliminating details that may cause a young brain (or even my old brain) to scatter and wander. It brings the story focus, and keeps the truth. Larsen has taken the opportunity to use the "Now What" section to tie in the big picture of the Gospel right from the beginning. For me, this is an essential element that I look for in a good book. One of the first things I did was flip to the back of the book to the stories telling of Jesus' death and resurrection and the early church. I read through the "Now What" sections looking for any details that may tell my child how or why to become saved. At first, it appeared that I wouldn't find what I was looking for. Disappointed, I flipped to Genesis. There it was. With the telling of Adam and Eve's sin, came the Gospel. Right at the beginning, exactly where it was needed. We need a Savior and here's why and here is where you can find Him.

It was a quote, by Che, in reference to his trip to New York City in 1964 to address the United Nations' General Assembly. It seems that while he was in New York there were two attempts on his life, one by a man wielding a gun and one by a woman with a knife. When asked about these attacks by a journalist, he is said to have responded with a smile and a bemused wisecrack: "It is better to be killed by a woman with a knife than a man with a gun" said Che.

I had extra batter so I made two other small pans of bread to use as samples at the market. The pans are really small; I felt like I was cooking with my Easy Bake Oven! Also, as my loaf tins were smaller, I baked them for about 20 minutes.

This book really was a pleasure to read, a pick up any time kind of read, in between cooking tea or bathing the kids. In fact it took me less than 24 hours to read this book! I've read a lot of stories of abuse over the last few years, to the point that they started to be unshockable. It was nice to have a different take on a child in care. While Cathy as a foster mother is obviously an official role, you wouldn't get a story like this from other 'officials' eg: social workers.
Did you know that in the world today there are 143 million orphans? They have no family to claim them and no parents to call their own. Many of them age out of the orphanages and become homeless, turning to drugs, suicide, or prostitution. Yet they are not without hope! The Lord cares for the orphans and following God's call in our life, we desire to give them a home, love, and a family to call their own. Please join us in praying for the orphans around the world that they would have enough food to eat, for someone to care for them, and for their protection. Please also pray that God would care for and provide for them until their adopting families can come get them. Pray that God would give us wisdom, discernment, and insight as we raise our adopted children.

So end our readers' tributes to Hitch. As I expect many of you have been doing, I've spent quite a few hours over the last two weeks watching videos of Christopher in debate, giving talks, or taking down pompous talking heads on television. I could recommend my favorites, but suggest instead that you just find a random one and follow the YouTube links. You will be impressed: for someone who talked so often, he rarely repeated himself, and everything he said sounded fresh. We have nobody to replace this man, but, thank Ceiling Cat, he left us a legacy of not only his writings and the example of his courage, but also the visual record of his eloquence and incessant fight for the truth.

I don't know.maybe nobody else feels like this about indie publishing. But this is sort of where I think I am with it. It's wonderful on so many levels - but its big flaw, I think, is that it's just too easy. Too easy to implement.too easy to mess up.too easy to get discouraged (because your frame of reference when you're solo is really quite small). Too easy, essentially, to jump in when you're green and flounder around.because you're green.

Then finally, they put me on depakote. I am mentioning this drug by name because I have heard from several other women that they believe depakote was the cause of this for them too, and a doctor at a California University said that he strongly, strongly believes that it gives PCOS to young women. Then I heard that some doctors have been instructed not to prescribe it to women under 40. Depakote won't own up to that and they knowingly let the doctors prescribe it (at least, until recently from what I hear). I don't want to get into who my sources are because I don't want to get anyone in trouble. It's very good for seizures, my brother had to take it for years and it kept him alive, but for Bipolar- not so much.

Color mixing went very fast for this too. I'm getting more confident with it. My blues are greyed with orange, and my reds with green. I'm finding that my blues go toward orange too much, and I think I'm going to start using black and white to grey my colors a bit more along with compliments. It really depends on the color though. Because every color has a cast to it, and isn't a perfect blue or orange, when you mix them to get grey you can get unpredictable results, and I like that, but I want to get more control over it in a more predictable way, so straight up grey should help.

Admiral Ororod did not garner the complete respect of those under him; he had connections, came from a well-to-do family with important political ties, more a bureaucrat with aspirations for a political career than a military career, he ran his detachment more like a business than the military unit it was. He may have been far from the most inspirational of fleet officers, but his politically minded motivations also helped to ensure that the Orion was one of the top training vessels in all the fleet.

I just did not love this one. I struggled to get through it and debated not finishing it multiple times. There was just too much language and content for me.

It is difficult to make a living from writing. I haven't cracked it yet, although I can see my income growing as I get more interest from foreign publishers and - crucially - manage to keep on producing books. If I compare it, though, to my career in journalism, I'm quite happy. Although I could earn considerably more with a staff job on a national newspaper (and they aren't any easier to come by than getting a book deal), my salary would be pretty much my limit. Whereas a book..well, anything could happen. It's possible for a book to earn for you again and again - a foreign sale here, a film deal there - while you're working on other stuff.

Sort of the flip side of the last post when I was wondering what we should commit ourselves to crafting as a group. What do you think you is worth some money in the Station Cash Store? What should we consider buying?
How does this event foreshadow the ministry of the Levites? (As we will see later, the Levites will be chosen of all the tribes of Israel to attend to the Tabernacle and the religious service. "Then Moses said, 'You have been set apart to the Lord today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day." (Exodus 32:29 NIV))
Audrey subsequently suffered a heart attack, brought on in part by the stress of dealing with her feud with David over the ownership of what was formerly her hair salon.

He also sought to break from the class-conscious conventions of the 1930s and early 40s, when top hat and tails or tuxedos were the norm, by dancing in casual or everyday work clothes, so as to make his dancing more relevant to the cinema-going public. As his first wife, actress and dancer Betsy Blair explained: "A sailor suit or his white socks and loafers, or the T-shirts on his muscular torso, gave everyone the feeling that he was a regular guy, and perhaps they too could express love and joy by dancing in the street or stomping through puddles.he democratized the dance in movies."[14] In particular, he wanted to create a completely different image from that associated with Fred Astaire, not least because he believed his physique didn't suit such refined elegance: "I used to envy his cool aristocratic style, so intimate and contained. Fred wears top hat and tails to the manner born - I put them on and look like a truck driver."[2]

Here is my newest pet, purchased last week at a garden show. I was told this is a Chinese Sedum succulent, and I fell in love with it in this trophy-shaped urn. There were so many booths dedicated to succulents, terrariums, and fairy gardens. It was so much fun!
I used paper from My Minds Eye-Playful Posies paper stack. I cut the shape at 4.39 x 9.66 using my gypsy to weld the shape together. The frame layer is cut at 4.39 x 4.91 which I embossed with the polka dots folder. I distressed the edges with Tim Holtz distress ink-old paper.
Here it is. The real purpose of the visit to Pho 68. Pho with rare beef and braised beef. It looked the part, and tasted it too. They've got the makings of a really good pho here. The stock was excellent. Deep, aromatic and intensely savoury. Wafer thin slices of beef were rare on arrival but cooked through as time progressed, the gentle poaching keeping them tender. The braised beef (brisket I think) was also sliced thin, but had a stronger, minerally flavour. The tendon running through it was soft and gelatinous speaking of long, slow cooking. The noodles, save for a little gluey clump at the top, were cooked just right.
Had I been super concerned over my belly (which I am not, I don't mind if people know this comes from having just had a little one), I could have gone one size up, but five months from now I may have regretted that decision (I overbought larger sized tops with CW and couldn't wear them a year later).
The start was quite unceremonious, no real count down, just an air horn and someone telling us loudly to go. Everyone seemed a bit shocked for a second before we were off.

Biologists generally agree, however that one feature above all others defines the orchid and differentiates it from virtually all other flowering plants - the fusion of the male portion of the flower (stamens) and the female portion (pistils). Orchid flowers are pollinated by a great variety of flying animals, and their diversity in floral structure has resulted from adaptations to various pollinators. About half the orchid species are pollinated by bees; moths, butterflies, flies, birds, and other agents pollinate the rest. Many orchid flowers are adapted for pollination by a single species of insect.

After making use of a convenient tree-stump chair (carved in situ by a friendly forester), I continue northwards towards Riding Bottom. On the left, more clear-felled pines, very recent judging by the greenness of the snedded branches and freshness of the chips spewed out by the chainsaw. On the right, by contrast, another low stone wall, topped with smoothly serpentine roots and limbs of beech, the boundary of Riding Copse beyond.

I can imagine them saying that it is my time to give back to my father for all he has done for me. That there are things I will be learning in this experience, marathon that it is. They would point out that it is an opportunity for me to develop and express a selfless love. And they would remind me that my father, even in his condition, matters to God. His soul is intact even as his mind is fading.

One of Geras' guest writers is British professor Eve Garrard, who in her latest post takes on writers Fintan O'Toole, from Ireland, and Iain Banks, from the UK. OK, none of these people is particularly famous as a Middle East commenter, but I'm concerned about arguments, especially when they're often repeated in essentially the same form. Garrard:
Condiments I had not witnessed being added to beer in the college bar scene and a practice I don't see much of, if at all, when Furry Husband and I go out to eat, which isn't often. We do most of our drinking at home, a glass of wine with dinner. Our alcohol choices these days are bottled, microbrew beers and wine.

"Our results suggest that long-term meditators have white-matter fibers that are either more numerous, more dense or more insulated throughout the brain," Dr. Luders said in a statement to the media. "We also found that the normal age-related decline of white-matter tissue is considerably reduced in active meditation practitioners."
It still tasted awesome, despite the lack of cheesy pocket. My guess is this has something to do with the flavor injector's flimsy plastic needle. The injector The Shannons linked looks like a fancy one with a metal needle. I may try it again sometime anyway.

Now that a few days have passed, I look back on that Chrysalis weekend with such joy. I don't think about the logistics of it all, I think about how present God was throughout it. With God's help, that weekend was flawless. And as I sat on Sunday listening to these girls talk about how positively affected they were by this weekend.. I knew at that very instant that every bit of sweat and tears was worth it.

Billy slowly drove into Casey's driveway, and although she had been through a night of fear and terror, she felt nothing other than happiness and joy when she saw her house. It looked like heaven to Casey because she wasn't even sure if she would live to see daylight. Casey slung open the truck door and jumped out of Billy's truck in lightening speed. As she ran up to the driver's side and softly said "I know exactly what happened last night, Billy. You guys drugged me and raped me. And I will never forget it. You're going to get away with it because I am too ashamed to tell anyone what you guys did to me. You can bet your ass that God will avenge my honor. You may not go to jail, but you will suffer for what you did to me." Billy looked at her, and he was completely stunned that she remembered what had happened. This is probably due to, the fact that they gave her what they thought was a drug that would make her forget. Evidently, the effects weren't as potent as Billy had hoped.

As things stand at the moment, it is the prevailing view within the Church of England that -- to adopt a minimalist position -- God's Word on the subject of marriage is relatively clear. If there is dissent from that view in the congregation, it is therefore surely the task of the teaching office to correct it.
On the one hand, it absolutely deserves an five-star review for its sheer audacity, innovation, and mastery of language. This is a very clever, beautifully written novel that manages to deliberately meander without boring the reader. It's also a very humorous novel, not so much in a laugh-out-loud sort of way, but one which succeeds in delivering a smile (or more often a smirk) per page. When I allowed myself to become lost in Arno's voice, I quite enjoyed the read, even as I rolled my eyes and scoffed at his good-natured laziness. It's no wonder Baker gets far more attention as a purveyor of literature than as a genre author, but you get the sense that's entirely how he likes it.

Meet Samantha. But we hardly ever call her that. Mostly, we call her Little D. That's D, for Diva. Because it's all about her. After a long weekend visiting family in Pennsylvania, we came home and adopted her at the humane society. There, she was named Thelma. You can plainly see that name just didn't suit her. (Actually, I wanted to name her Tootsie and the hubby wanted to name her Tarot. Then I jokingly suggested Samantha because she was being a little naughty at the time - she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter. Anyway, I said to my hubby that we should call her Samantha because "naughty girls need love too". Ha. What can I say, I was a teenager in the 80s.)

But then something else happened. That same baby that was gifted to her from heaven, the one she felt growing and moving in her womb, the same child that gave her pleasure every time he said 'mama', fell ill and died, in her lap.
So, adoptive families must be more exact with their questions, since many of them probably would argue that baby-buying is corruption. Instead of asking, "Do you feel there is wide-spread corruption in China's program?" a better question might be "Do you feel that paying substantial amounts of money for children is adoption corruption? And how wide-spread do you feel this baby-buying is?" It may be that he hedges, like the villager in the opening story, out of a reluctance to air China's dirty laundry, for there is one characteristic of the Chinese that I understand very well, having lived with one for seven years: The Chinese do not like to reveal the dirty secrets of their country, even to friends. It is a tradition and understanding that goes back hundreds of years. We might view it as lying, but the Chinese consider it "saving face."

The story begins last May when, out of the blue, I received an email from Australia. Mick, the sender of said email, had stumbled across my blog when he was researching his family history. He introduced himself and explained that he had been through Kolky before and was very excited to learn that there was someone who he could communicate with now living in this village. His connection to Kolky, as well as other villages in my general area, came from some documents of his wife's side of the family. He also explained that he and Julie were coming to Eastern Europe again (among other places on their 6 week excursion) to retrace some of their steps, do some more searching and continue their investigation. Also he mentioned that one of their stops was Kolky!

I refuse as a matter of principle to put a bike stand on Jas's bike (sorry Jas) and if next year when the local cop in charge of bike testing doesn't pass the bike because of it's lack of a stand then so be it, to date there's no legal requirement for bikes to have stands to make them roadworthy therefore our bikes will be standless and I shall stand my ground on that one.
A few years ago I discovered 'osteopathic manipulative treatment' (OMT) and the pain in my knee mysteriously disappeared. But by then I was fully in the throes of motherhood and exercise had been off the table for so long that I didn't know how to get it back into my life. I still don't really know how I will accomplish this task, I just know that I must. I need an exercise montage. I need abdominal muscles.

Yet let us analyze these implications in their general form. Starting with an increase in extreme weather, the erosion of soils and weak rock will increase. This will cause more of the imposing landmasses to crumble into the sea leading to an even greater rise in sea level. The changes will exponentially become more and more unpredictable. A chaotic patter will emerge which can never be studied. People will panic, but the plain fact is that nature is beyond their control. Sea levels will rise, temperatures will spike, and weather will be out of control. Everything will seem to be pointing toward an inevitable apocalypse.
After nearly coming to grief in an uncovered water meter cavity we turned into the pedestrian walkway, where the pavement surfaces were level and safe, only to narrowly avoid being run down by two men on motor scooters.....the municipal police, protecting the public.

Pure simply means it is not artificial. Pure vanilla extract is made by steeping chopped vanilla beans with ethyl alcohol and water. Manufacturers can use a variety of types and qualities of beans. The process of extraction takes about 48 hours then the mixture is placed in tanks from anywhere from a few days to several weeks. The aged mixture is then filtered, placed in holding tanks and eventually bottled. I was surprised to find out that pure extracts may still contain sugar, corn syrup, colors and stabilizers.
But even getting out officially isn't easy. I believe that the US and its allies don't really give a tinker's curse about Afghanistan; as far as they are concerned, if the Afghans are intent on living in a barbaric medieval theocracy, where women are treated as chattels, those who don't share the faith of the rulers live in fear of death, and there're more or less continual low-level wars between various tribes, then they're welcome to do so. Admittedly, there is the poppy problem - Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of non-pharmaceutical grade opiates (92% in 2007) and also, incidentally, the world's largest producer of hashish - but, despite all the hype about the so-called War on Drugs, I have a feeling that (for all sorts of reasons, many sordid, which I won't go into here) the US and most other countries can live with that. No, the real problems are the two 500 pound

On the one hand, it absolutely deserves an five-star review for its sheer audacity, innovation, and mastery of language. This is a very clever, beautifully written novel that manages to deliberately meander without boring the reader. It's also a very humorous novel, not so much in a laugh-out-loud sort of way, but one which succeeds in delivering a smile (or more often a smirk) per page. When I allowed myself to become lost in Arno's voice, I quite enjoyed the read, even as I rolled my eyes and scoffed at his good-natured laziness. It's no wonder Baker gets far more attention as a purveyor of literature than as a genre author, but you get the sense that's entirely how he likes it.

In May 2005, the Central Bank published its 'Fit and Proper' Guideline (sic) and that document can be found at http://www.central-bank.org.tt/news/releases/2005/mr050510.pdf. It is a critical part of this discourse since it sets out the official position as to the type of person held to be 'fit and proper' to be a Director or Officer of a Financial Institution.

Even in a nation's history 86 years is a long time. I remember the salient points of the change from British to Scottish. None of them was political. We never got the jail for the Stone. The people cheered us. There was public support for our 'no numeral' campaign when Elizabeth the 'Second' came to the throne. Scotland had had no 'First' Elizabeth. Our coronation souvenirs without the numeral were wildly popular. The newspapers backed us in their news columns but refused to take our paid advertisements. They were feart as they still are.

And then there's the moment when it all stops. Its like pressing the button that has a warning sign hung over it. Or like entering the garden that says "beware of the dog". Sometimes you just gotta beat the odds and see how you turn up around the end. You realize that many people including society, people, extended family, friends expect you to live a certain way. A way that they would approve of. A way that pleases them. It wouldn't bring them real happiness but it would leave them guiltless yet content. So when you stop walking on the sidelines and take a detour to the destination you think you belong to or transform yourself to the person you want to be. The one that really makes YOUR heart happy, you don't see a lot of takers. You don't even find many standing by your side at the end of the journey. You din't fit the bill. You can't be a part of the group coz you're now an extrovert not an introvert. You can't get trodden to the ground. You won't take everyone's bullshit and hide it in your heart but you will give an equally tough fight. Maybe tougher. You won't run to that emo corner and cry it off and emerge like you rose from the dead- So now, this confident, outgoing self is not acceptable.

I wouldn't dismiss this one going beyond 90 minutes, which depending on the scoreline, could well very work out in Man City's favour if they have scored more than one away goal. Oddly, away goals only count until after extra time in the Carling Cup.

I want to start with talking about Sawyer and Kate because I believe that this relationship was arguably the more apparent of the two, definitely the more active and perhaps even the more popular choice for indifferent/casual viewers. Why? Because Sawyer and Kate together was the obvious choice, the easy choice, and the in many ways expected direction for the characters to head in.
And by the laughter, I surmise that she could tell without me letting her in on the secret. Apparently, besides my accent deepening into obscurity, I raised my voice several decibels and reverted to my Ghanenglish grammar peppered with Dagbani, something that is significantly different from the speech my Canadian-raised family is used to. And now I'm laughing and blushing, and internally cringing because I feel proud to retain vestiges of my Ghanaian communication skills, but wondering how to balance this maintenance of my slightly shifted identity while re-learning how to connect with Canadians. Especially because I need to sound polished and professional at my upcoming interviews for medicine.

Given NuLabour's visceral hatred and contempt for the white working class, who's interests so often conflicts with those now much preferred groups, many observers would have assumed that Denham was either making a bad joke and had forgotten the punchline, or was suffering from some catastrophic mental breakdown, had they, that is, not realised that an election is imminent.

Why did they grumble? Why were they so upset? Because from their perspective they had been cheated. "What's in it for me" is the governing question (Matthew 19:27 puts this very question on the lips of Peter).

I went to the front desk and explained what happened and luckily they did give us a room (it would have been a long trip home!). We got the same type of room, same rate, but it was a handicapped accessible room. They probably hold those rooms back in case they are needed. I don't know yet if I got charged for our missed night. I had reserved the room with a card that I subsequently canceled (due to fraud). So I don't know if they would have been able to charge it or not.
So end our readers' tributes to Hitch. As I expect many of you have been doing, I've spent quite a few hours over the last two weeks watching videos of Christopher in debate, giving talks, or taking down pompous talking heads on television. I could recommend my favorites, but suggest instead that you just find a random one and follow the YouTube links. You will be impressed: for someone who talked so often, he rarely repeated himself, and everything he said sounded fresh. We have nobody to replace this man, but, thank Ceiling Cat, he left us a legacy of not only his writings and the example of his courage, but also the visual record of his eloquence and incessant fight for the truth.

There was that time I watched my father in a televised drama where he was portraying yet another down and out character. There was a part where he was cold and shivering and sad, and I am told I came out from under the dining table that was my favourite hiding spot and offered my blankie to the television set saying "Here daddy, you can have my blankie, you don't have to be cold!" The adults thought that was the sweetest, funniest thing ever, but to my four year old mind, my father was suffering and I wanted to help. I knew he was pretending, but could I be really, really sure he wasn't actually cold?
The point here is surely not to deride empiricism. Heaven knows conservatism could stand to quit leading with its heart and start thinking more empirically about the world as it is, not the world as they wish it to be. The point, if I'm reading them correctly, is that too many leading voices on the left give themselves over to wonkiness, and presume that their moral convictions are widely shared, such that the only reason anybody could disagree with them is through ignorance (willful or not), or malice.
The new characters were incredibly underdeveloped; Angelica, Blackbeard, the Minister, and the mermaid all felt forced upon the audience as if we were suppose to enjoy them, but realistically they were just annoying. Angelica is mad at Jack for taking her virginity (wasn't pirates suppose to be geared for Children?) Blackbeard hides in his cabin for most of the film (wasn't he the scariest pirates of all time?) the Minister falls in love with the mermaid (who in this film can shoot spiderwebs from their wrists like Spider-Man) just because he sees her naked (again, Disney, Pirates, Children?) and the Mermaid needs to shed one tear (there were enough tears of pain from the audience to solve that problem).

That the lives of these old fellows we see on television, and whose names we now know, go back more than a century, touches us - and it may add to the power they project for us that they are not especially heroic and do not represent themselves that way. That they do not posture or make use of any of the rhetorical cliches, but are modest survivors of the ordinary circumstances and perils of living. And that on television, where glamorisation is almost a given, so that any claim they might once have had to youthful beauty is simply irrelevant. Very young people, I suspect, who find themselves living in a dangerous and chaotic world, and with their own lives fearfully before them, feel a special affection for these old fellows who have indestructibily battled through - and even a small sense of reassurance ...

This is an important distinction. Where early web technologies enabled people to communicate primarily with friends and family, today's networks encourage discovery and new relationships. Twitter, for instance, helps people find others who share their interests and begin conversations with them. By using hashtags, Twitter's simple indexing tool, college students can connect with thought leaders and fellow students, expanding their intellectual circles beyond the reach of their classrooms and campuses.
We stood outside their house and hugged and prayed over them. I held each of them tight until they cried. They needed a mother's love and protection and the feel of safet, if only for a moment. I kissed them all over their faces and told them I loved them and we would see them again, and help them in the meantime. Isabelle and Johnny begged to give them all the food we had in the van, so we asked them to walk back with us. We walked down that path to the van, praying the whole way. I didn't know until later that night after looking at the pictures that we were all holding hands. Isabelle and Johnny love these girls too, and their hearts were broken and changed that day too.

Tonight (Sunday April 15, 2012) is the last night of our Spring Break, and I have to say we are all a bit gloomy. We have had soooo much fun together. I really do love spending time with my family, and we had fun this week. Here is a recap in pictures.
Having such a huge burden gone has effected everything. I am back to making my meals in the morning. My dishes routine is working again. I have had the extra time to put most my cupboards etc in order again. It's like there's a light at the end of the tunnel...with projects I have been craving to do for so long. Stuff I enjoy. The last week or two I have started to feel that old me again. That girl that used to enjoy LOTS of things. Feels so good.
And then there was the wind! The picture above shows the backyard of our son after the storm. That heavy propane grill was blown over - it took two of us to put it back. If you look carefully at the picture above (it can be enlarged), you'll see the leg of a chair that went through their fence. It was later reported that a tornado touched down a couple of miles from their house - I'm glad we didn't know about that at the time!

Step 2 - Drop and Bake: Drop batter by tablespoon onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in a well pre-heated 350º F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Do not over-bake. Cookies should be a bit gooey in the center. While warm, they will be very soft on the outside, as well. Allow them to cool on the pan a few minutes and then transfer carefully to a rack to finish cooling. (They will always be somewhat soft because these are gooey fudge brownie cookies, not hard or crunchy cookies.)

Hmm where do I start from? where? where? where.? Oh yeah, there!. So I'm quite certain that every believer knows what "New Creation" means (at least I hope so). When asked to define the term, words like "born-again", "salvation", "repentance", "baptism" etc are bound to be used in the definition. That's all good but who really is the "NEW CREATURE"? The creation story helped me understand this better so let's start from there. Once upon a time, God created man (and woman), gave him authority over everything on earth (Genesis 1:27-31) and placed him in the Garden of Eden where man could be close to HIM (GOD) all the time. One day, the enemy of God (and all God's children), satan, tricked man into sinning against God. Satan gave man "sin and the pleasures that come with it" and in return man gave up his authority over earth and everything in it, hence, man came under the rulership of satan. Uhmm.. yeah I guess you can call it an exchange. satan brought sin to man and man paid with his authority over the earth. A poor exchange indeed.but hey, it was no robbery. Anyway, satan, having all the authority now, become the ruler of man; and man the slave of satan (Jesus replied, "Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin" John 8:32). Man was forever doomed as a slave of the enemy and like anyone who is sentenced to life imprisonment without appeal, the only way of escape is DEATH. Scary huh? I know! Well, God who created man and loved man in spite of man's disobedience wanted to free His creation from bondage so He had to send no one else but LIFE to set man free. The Son of God, JESUS CHRIST is LIFE (Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the LIFE.John 14:6; "In him was LIFE.John 1:4). JESUS was/is the only ONE who can set man free.WHY? Think of it this way. Man's only hope of escaping the slavery of satan is death and we all know everyone dies but once. You have one chance to live and after that, there is death and judgement etc. God couldn't watch man die in his sins so there had to be another way to set man free and that way is JESUS. Jesus came on the earth as a man, suffered and died.but uh huh, that's the best part. He died not just for dying sake but He died so He could defeat DEATH. He had to defeat death so He could give man a second chance to life. For 3 days He was dead but on the 3rd day, He rose again having won POWER over death."..Whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have EVERLASTING life" John 3:16. Everlasting life is possible in Jesus because He holds both the power of LIFE (because He is LIFE) and DEATH(because He defeated death) in His hands. Any man who then believes in Him is set free from slavery through death but is given another chance to live and is given a NEW LIFE. Jesus creates the old slave who died anew and breathes LIFE again into his nostrils to make him a living soul.(Then the LORD God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being: Genesis 2:7). This is why anyone who is born-again/born in Christ is said to be a NEW CREATURE (Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new: 2 Corinthians 5:17). Just like the first man ever created, the NEW CREATURE is not placed back on in the world he just got freed from, he is placed into a world, a place, a kingdom where he can be close to God again. The NEW CREATURE no longer belongs to the world of sin and slavery (.because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you- John 15:19). The blessings and authority (Gen. 1:28-31) man God first gave to man before the fall is returned to the NEW CREATURE who becomes part of the body of Christ (.and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all- Ephe. 1:20-23). Yup! Not only does the NEW YOU receive freedom and salvation in CHRIST, but you also receive power and authority over satan and his followers. So now you know.The "NEW YOU" who is born in CHRIST is more powerful and more important than can be comprehended. YOU are God's own precious POSSESSION bought at a very high price. YOU are PRICELESS as could be. Turn to HIS WORD to fully know the "NEW YOU" He created.

But life is not always a bed of roses because he still thinks of his ex-wife (Hélène Florent), his first love and original soul mate.

But Tom Hiddleston. Man, is Tom Hiddleston good. He plays Loki the same way he played the character in Thor, not as a cartoon villain but as an at times sympathetic man torn between the way he regards his brother with both familial love and burning jealousy. There are scenes between Thor and Loki where you can almost see Loki willing to put an end to all of this, but too far in to stop now. Loki is not absolutely a villain, and none of the heroes are absolutely heroes. They all have doubts and moments of cynicism. It's what elevates the movie beyond merely a collection of character moments and an action-packed third act: the continuing thread about what the nature of heroism really is, where it comes from, and how it can be used to affect the world. It was there in Captain America: The First Avenger when Steve Rogers told Dr. Erskine "I don't want to kill anybody. I don't like bullies. I don't care where they're from." It was there when Thor learned how to wield his power for others and Tony Stark conquered his daddy issues.

Even more importantly I think I'm having a rebirth of my spirit. For the longest time I've basically just existed. I've done the bare minimum around the house. It's been a struggle to get that done too. But the last few weeks I've been WANTING to spread my wings and take the time to make the homemade breads and the homemade snacks. I've been wanting to do that stuff. It's almost like I'm being reborn. I don't know what has brought this about. I'm afraid to blink...afraid that it will go away if I do. I still have all the stress and depression in my life....but I'm really trying to not let it affect ME. And maybe that's the whole difference.

The biggest emotion, though, is probably regret. Even though I was at the hospital several different times the week before he died, I never found the courage to really talk to him, to tell him that I forgave him for all the bad stuff. For the most part, I put all that behind me a long time ago, and focused on remembering the good times, the memories that can still make me smile. And that man is the one I miss, the man I wish was still here for Amy, to walk her down the aisle, to spoil our grandchildren, to sing to them.....

Meet Samantha. But we hardly ever call her that. Mostly, we call her Little D. That's D, for Diva. Because it's all about her. After a long weekend visiting family in Pennsylvania, we came home and adopted her at the humane society. There, she was named Thelma. You can plainly see that name just didn't suit her. (Actually, I wanted to name her Tootsie and the hubby wanted to name her Tarot. Then I jokingly suggested Samantha because she was being a little naughty at the time - she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter. Anyway, I said to my hubby that we should call her Samantha because "naughty girls need love too". Ha. What can I say, I was a teenager in the 80s.)

You only had a two year warranty, and, to be honest, I didn't think you'd last past it.
I'm not prepared for the breaking down of my best friend, for the suffering and slow burn of flames licking at all she holds dear, her light and her laughter and her little family, her safe haven and her confidence. I'm not sure if I'm willing to drag her through this with me.
The trail ends at the Atlantic & Yadkin Greenway, not far from Lake Brandt Road. By turning right, you can follow the Greenway back to Bur-Mil Park for a five-mile loop. The Owls Roosts Trail also offers an additional 1.25 miles of trail along a service road and an official shortcut that links the sections along the northern and southern arms of the lake.

Google now has a head start on its rivals in the fiercely competitive cloud computing market, thanks in part to deals inked with the US Patent and Trademark Office and the General Services Administration in the past year. In both cases, Google enjoyed the benefits of support from federal chief information officers. In both cases, a few people involved in the process voiced objections.

It was a simple chance event on a London underground station that got me thinking about luck, chance and randomness and led many years later to my new novel, Wasted. It wasn't an earth-shattering event but it got me thinking. Obsessively. So, I began a novel for adults - I'd two unpublished ones languishing already - about chance, quantum mechanics, and unpredictability, involving repeated multiple possibilities. The idea was that if there is a god - which I know there isn't - he will either play dice or at least have a lot of fun observing. But halfway through, a completely different idea hit me, this time for teenagers. I abandoned god and quantum
which I'm not.
Tophatter has had a few glitches with their software...the missed alert for my customer being one of them. The other one was their server crashed on Saturday night in the middle of the weekend bazaar auction mostly due to the number of auction attendees in the room, I think. It took them about 20 minutes to reset everything and they were back in business. The staff have been very attentive to their customers...buyers and sellers alike.
So I had fruit on my mind when I was surfing around Cargoh and was instantly smitten by the coconut earrings below. They were familiar yet eye-catching and undeniably fun. Sarah of Kawaii culture wanted to create "kawaii"jewelry, i.e. jewelry that is cute or lovable. Each clay piece is crafted to be durable and retain its coloring - so don't worry about cracking those coconuts! Loveable indeed and perfect for spring and summer!

I spent this past weekend at a retreat at the Seabeck Conference Center. I had to smile as I drove into Seabeck. The business district, if I don't count the Conference Center, consists of only about a half a dozen buildings, but when I arrived in town I was greeted by a small gray building with a bright blue door. White trim around the window caused the red "Espresso" sign to pop. I decided to go inside. The usual rows of flavors were lined up on a shelf; an espresso machine and a barista were visible from behind a tiny counter. Five or six wooden stools filled the remaining floor space- stools that were all occupied by the locals. They are a generous lot. I discovered that they will tease anyone. They didn't penalize me for being a visitor; locals and visitors are all teased alike.
Admiral Ororod did not garner the complete respect of those under him; he had connections, came from a well-to-do family with important political ties, more a bureaucrat with aspirations for a political career than a military career, he ran his detachment more like a business than the military unit it was. He may have been far from the most inspirational of fleet officers, but his politically minded motivations also helped to ensure that the Orion was one of the top training vessels in all the fleet.

The first step in making effective change in our behavior is awareness. So as a start, copy the list of offensive behaviors. After every sales call honestly evaluate yourself through the eyes of your prospect. For example, if you talked for more than 20% of the time, you are probably guilty of all of the first four offensive behaviors.

You are transformed into a world where rolling hills, sprawling vineyards, beautiful houses, and quaint villages take over. From lunch with a traditional Italian family to cooking pasta, visiting shops selling ham, cured meats and cheese, tasting wines and visiting a local factory making pasta, Antonio and Gennaro keeps you entertained with their wit and humour in Bologna- their first stop. Next they move on to the South of Italy to the Amalfi coast, where Gennaro grew up. Personally this was the most favourite episode for me. Cooking by the sea side, plucking fresh lemons off the trees and biting into them, preparing a linguine dish on a boat using fresh octopus and mussels which Gennaro collected after his diving expedition and the wit and humour the two Italians share among themselves were absolutely fun to watch. Ah! the ricotta and lemon tart they made in this episode still holds fresh in my memory. Its high up there on my to-make list.
As stated in his book "The Leadership Engine", Tichy Noel reinforces that learning is a key requirement for developing leadership. We enhance our unique qualities through learning and education. Studying abroad was probably one of the richest experiences of my life. It was a privilege to study for my MBA at Duke, The Fuqua School of Business. It was a unique moment of my life. The globally focused education allowed me to make a deep personal assessment while providing me with an actionable set of global leadership tools. (Not to mention that I met my wife during my MBA, this is awesome).
Dan and I are both so touched by this amazingly generous gift.
The aroma was filled with the recognizable smell of Smith and Cross: strong, funky and full of promise. Of course the molasses was there as well, though I am still not sure if I was smelling the actual molasses or the Smith and Cross. Also, the pineapple spear, which was an utter garnish failure, awkward protuberance that it was, added a bit of undefinable fruitiness to the nose. The first sip was very molasses-y, though the hogo of the rum carried through at the end. You would think that there would be some sweetness in this drink, but it was dry and earthy, with a vague powdery texture that made each sip seem almost chewy. After I increased the bitters, the spices became more detectable on the swallow. The flavors of the molasses were also enhanced by the increase in bitters--the drink seemed sweeter, in that pleasing molasses cookie way, and the flavors in general seemed more balanced. Overall, not bad but not great.

For me it didn't get bad until after the D&C. I suppose I assumed that it would be the same this time. But then I have to remind myself that it was almost as if I had 3 weeks to deal with the shock of it all before I actually "lost" my baby. This time I knew that I couldn't deal with the emotional turmoil associated with waiting for things to happen naturally as my body obviously has a very difficult time letting go. I gave myself one day to let in soak in, to say goodbye to my sweet child, and then took Cytotec again (which this time didn't even make me bleed at all) and had the D&C on Thursday.

Last week saw another turn of direction for the brand with the news that the Genii Capital-owned F1 team has terminated its sponsorship agreement with Group Lotus. Financial uncertainty has surrounded Group Lotus since the investment arm of the Malaysian Government, Khazanah, selling its near on 43 percent stake in Lotus parent company Proton, to another Malaysian entity, DRB-Hicom. Those famous insiders surfaced in various reports saying that the sale of Proton was a contributing reason for Genii cancelling its sponsorship agreement.

I want to live more useful life and write about it.

Pat colored this lovely frog more times than you can imagine today. Here's one of her little green friends that I managed to catch on camera before it hoped away. This frog was colored with light green, shaded with dark green, then Pat dabbed some colorless blender onto a rag and added the fine texture.
Let's examine the second half of the video. One protester calls out 'Mic check!,' and everyone knows what this means. This guy will speak for us, he has something to say. And if they disagree, they can simply stop passing this person's words along. But in this case he speaks words of de-escalation. We will let you police leave. He's teaching the police a lesson in non-violence. It's amazing to see this at work.

Established in 1892, CILEx was known as the Institute of Legal Executives (ILEX) in 1963 before changing its name in January 2012 when it received a royal charter. According to CILEx, 81.5 per cent of its members have parents who studied at university. Only 2 per cent of members have a lawyer for a parent. Clearly, CILEx operates in different circles from the magic-circle law firms, which have attracted criticism in the past for using the old boys' network of recruitment.
The guru, or acaryadeva, as we learn from the bona fide scriptures, delivers the message of the absolute world, the transcendental abode of the Absolute Personality, where everything nondifferentially serves the Absolute Truth. We have heard so many times: mahajano yena gata sa pantha ("Traverse the trail which your previous acarya has passed"), but we have hardly tried to understand the real purport of this sloka. If we scrutinizingly study this proposition, we understand that the mahajana is one, and the royal road to the transcendental world is also one. In the Muaka Upaniad (1.2.12) it is said:

Even more importantly I think I'm having a rebirth of my spirit. For the longest time I've basically just existed. I've done the bare minimum around the house. It's been a struggle to get that done too. But the last few weeks I've been WANTING to spread my wings and take the time to make the homemade breads and the homemade snacks. I've been wanting to do that stuff. It's almost like I'm being reborn. I don't know what has brought this about. I'm afraid to blink...afraid that it will go away if I do. I still have all the stress and depression in my life....but I'm really trying to not let it affect ME. And maybe that's the whole difference.
This post wants to highlight the challenges, that come along with the recent phenomenon of Chinese tourists, as well as discuss Taiwan's current struggles as a travel destination and travel nation. Taiwan is truly a big step ahead of China, when it comes to travel etiquette and service, however, there is still room for improvement. I believe, that we need to give Chinese tourists some time, they will make mistakes and we need to firmly point them out, but they will also learn and improve through time - some more, some less. I'm interested to hear what you say! Here are some of my questions:

It's been a while - since December, in fact - since I pulled out the brew equipment. Well, with the return of summer, and my recently purchased, though not yet assembled MLT, the time has come to make some beer.

It is relatively obvious that certain international business pursuits are more likely to influence environmental conditions. These types of businesses need to be especially concerned about the fashion in which they conduct business. They must assure citizens that the environment will not be tarnished for decades to come. I have no qualms about them facilitating business in an international setting, but they need to make sure that the environment doesn't become degraded as a result of their organizational operations.

"Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance...I just want to praise Him...I want to praise Him..." I watched in my rear view mirror as she lifted her little hands in the air and shouted "I want to praise HIM!" and I just knew she totally understood! In her little way she was praising God. She didn't care if a car passed and saw her...she just did it!

Personally, I am a fan of books like this that help bridge the gap to help children graduate from reading Bible picture books to actually digesting Scripture. And while it is not a homeschool "curriculum", it would certainly adapt well as a Bible curriculum, especially if your family enjoys the New Living Translation. On the other hand, children this age are incredibly impressionable. They are thinking and absorbing so much. It is time to sharpen up on your theology. I have read some Bible storybooks where the stories are retold in a way that uses soft theology or even sways the story by adding (or omitting) details to the original text. The mere fact that someone picks and chooses only certain Bible stories to retell means that the person has at least some control of what the final presentation looks like. In this book, Carolyn Larsen has condensed the Scripture to retell each story, but (as you can see from the one example above) she is merely eliminating details that may cause a young brain (or even my old brain) to scatter and wander. It brings the story focus, and keeps the truth. Larsen has taken the opportunity to use the "Now What" section to tie in the big picture of the Gospel right from the beginning. For me, this is an essential element that I look for in a good book. One of the first things I did was flip to the back of the book to the stories telling of Jesus' death and resurrection and the early church. I read through the "Now What" sections looking for any details that may tell my child how or why to become saved. At first, it appeared that I wouldn't find what I was looking for. Disappointed, I flipped to Genesis. There it was. With the telling of Adam and Eve's sin, came the Gospel. Right at the beginning, exactly where it was needed. We need a Savior and here's why and here is where you can find Him.

SkyWest's total operating revenues increased $55.2 million, or 6.4%, during the quarter ended March 31, 2012, over the same period in 2011. The increase in operating revenues was the result of higher pass-through costs (primarily fuel and engine overhaul costs) under SkyWest's agreements with its major partners and an increase in block hour production. The increase in operating revenues was offset by a planned reduction in prorate flying block hours of 13.4% resulting in reduced revenues of approximately $6.0 million. In spite of the reducing operating revenues from prorate flying, SkyWest's revenue per available seat mile for this flying increased 14.6% from improved pricing. After excluding the increased pass-through costs of approximately $31.1 million, for fuel and engine overhauls, and the reduction in prorate flying revenue of $6.0, total operating revenues increased approximately $30.1 million due to the additional block hour production of 3.1% and improved utilization. Total block hours for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 were 556,421 compared to 539,910 for the same period last year.

Yes and no. Ordinary sexuality dimly reflects the external appearance of this necklace; but in truth these women are the direct All-Attractive Energies (bhagavan-prakti), the divine goddesses, eternal manifestations of the fullness of the Absolute All-Attractive Being.
A closer look at the jewellery rack shows the Swarovski rack, pearl rack, gemstone rack, some still to be bagged and sorted stones, Scrabble tiles for pendants, many MANY pairs of pliers and cutters, the world's largest collection of steel wool, hundreds of dollars worth of sterling silver wire, and a train case FULL of unset stones for ring making!
This is a planting festival. The enactment of ritual consummation of the God and Goddess is done symbolically by placing a knife in a chalice. This is sympathetic magic. The meaning of which is to have a bountiful harvest later in the year.

But going down through the water to touch the wild man at the bottom of the pond is quite a different matter. The being who stands up is frightening, and he seems even more so now, when corporations do so much work to produce the sanitized, hairless shallow man (2) That's poor Viggo in THE ROAD, a sanitized man re-bearded, trying to be wild in a wild land, having to re-learn the role of the deep, dark masculine and getting it incorrect. No reflection on Viggo, of course, who showed he can bring that shit hardcore in the RINGS films and HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. It's more I think the head-on craftsmanshippy approach to the McCarthy novel -- it gets it too right, maybe, to work. Teardrop on the other hand is the untamed wild man, the kind of guy that creeps you out at first but then somewhere along the way, not sure when, you start to admire him.

Mendy, as much as I, found this almost too good to be true and a bit hard to believe, even though all sorts of wonderful beings show up in her office all the time. As she said later, though, she has a great deal of experience with this stuff and she feels confident of being able to sniff out a fraud. Stephen did not appear to be a fraud, not to either of us. I had a feeling of the sublime, no sense of anything that might raise an alarm.
This is an example of churnalism at its laziest worst. Or is it something more sinister? The statement from the court suggested that "Such inventions are a kind of blood libel, and we wonder why the inventor of the story did not continue to describe how we collected the blood of the dog to make our matzah." That might be going too far. But it says a lot about BBC journalism that they imagined that stoning reincarnated dog lawyers to death was the sort of thing Orthodox Jews get up to.
Inspired by the TED talk that Graham Hill gave about becoming a weekday vegetarian, I too am going to aspire for that. I want to make sure that i am able to uphold my agreement so my aim to eat vegetarian for 4 out of the 7 days of the week. So I will have the weekends to enjoy meat, and one day of the week if i am especially feeling like i need to have a nice burger or something. This effects so many parts of the global environment that it is something that a lot of people need to consider. It will help with energy use, preserving land, animal rights, cut back on unhealthy foods and water pollution.
Although Emily knows her math facts fairly well, she could stand to improve her speed, so I was interested to see how Math Rider would stack up against other programs we've tried. It teaches mastery of all 4 math operations with numbers 1-12 and is designed for children ages 6-12. To play, the child begins a "quest." A short story scenario is given, then the child rides his or her horse, "Shadow," across deserts, mountains, and so on. Math problems appear at the bottom of the screen. As the problem is answered, the horse jumps over an obstacle. If the problem is missed, the horse stops while the game gives the correct answer. The problems and speed are adjusted to the child's abilities, with problems the child has trouble with generated more frequently.

Covey amplifies his message by means of wide-ranging examples of "third alternative thinkers". There's the local police force that transformed a crime-plagued community by casting off its entrenched "them against us" mentality. Another example tells the tale of a father who, during the course of one extraordinary evening, rescued his daughter from years of clinical depression. Then there's the judge who brought a swift and peaceful end to a massive environmental lawsuit without setting foot in a courtroom.
Written for ages 6 and older this is one of many delightful books in the Katie Woo series. I no longer have children or grandchildren this age but the title reminded me of my 8-year-old granddaughter (kind of a Madame Fullcharge) and I thought she and I would have fun reading it together. She wasn't interested. Said it was too young for her. That might be because she just finishing up her 4th grade brothers book, Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief. Anyway I thought the book was great and I still think she would have enjoyed it. I'll bet if I could have figured out how to get it onto Kindle she may have read it.
There were times where I was frustrated to tears--and a bloody nose-- giving up and threading my way to freedom with my hands outstretched to prevent further injury. Since those days, I have seen halls of mirrors in traveling carnivals, but none were as large and complicated as P.O.P.'s. None had the distracting, dizzying lights that lent a sense of spaciousness and multiplied like a field of supernovas against the glass. Once inside, you banged endlessly against your likenesses, trapped in a world of a thousand yous!

It is nearly impossible to engender the necessary confidence, trust and loyalty a leader must possess without being fully engaged. A leader spends as much time out of the confines of the office engaging in real conversation with people as they do in their office planning, decision-making and organizing. Whether in person, over the phone, via email, through the social web, or even by sending a good old fashion "thank you" note - be an engaging conversationalist.

Method - 'A Mayonnaise of Salmon may consist of a large centre-cut, a thick slice, or the remains of cold salmon cut into pieces convenient for serving. In all cases the skin and bone must be removed, and the fish completely masked with thick Mayonnaise sauce, the stiffening properties of which are greatly increased by the addition of a little liquid, but nearly cold, aspic jelly. When procurable, a little endive should be mixed with the lettuce, for although the somewhat bitter flavour of this salad plant is disliked by many people, its delicate, feathery leaves greatly improve the appearance of any dish which it forms a part. Many other garnishings, in addition to those enumerated above, may be used; the leaves of the tarragon and chervil plants, and fancifully-cut thin slices of truffle, being particularly effective when used to decorate the surface of Mayonnaise sauce.'

Overheard by reporters standing outside a closed door campaign fundraiser in toney Palm Beach where the parking lot was valet-filled with Porsches, Mercedes, Hummers and a Maserati, Mitt threw out the following tidbits:
The point of cleavage between those who hold the crude theory of Baptismal regeneration, ex opere operato, and those who maintain what is usually spoken of as the "Hypothetical Theory," lies just here. The former believe that the recital of a formula and the performance of a particular action necessarily produce the spiritual effect of regeneration; the latter hold that where believing prayer is offered for a blessing, which we have reason to believe it is God's will to grant, that prayer will be provisionally answered. The former believe that this spiritual result is absolute, and admits of being neither reversed nor supplemented; the latter maintain that the result, whatever it is, must needs be provisional in its character, and cannot be made absolute until the condition upon which in the case of an adult it is contingent is complied with. The former maintain that the saving effect of this ordinance may be lost by wilful sin; the latter maintain that such saving effects only remain if the condition on which they are contingent is complied with, and, even where wilful sin does not occur, are forfeited by the non-fulfilment of the appointed condition. According to the former theory, no baptized member of our congregations needs to be born again, or, indeed, can be, although his life may be a discredit to our common humanity, and it would seem that the only hope for him lay in the possibility of so radical a change ; according to the other, all who have never consciously exercised faith in the special promise of God made in Baptism need to be told, "Ye must be born again." The difference between the two positions, which may seem to be slight, is really radical. The Gorham judgment given on appeal by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council affirmed that the hypothetical explanation of the formularies of the Church of England was a perfectly reasonable and legitimate one, though it did not affirm that it was the only possible interpretation. See GORHAM CASE.

There was that time I watched my father in a televised drama where he was portraying yet another down and out character. There was a part where he was cold and shivering and sad, and I am told I came out from under the dining table that was my favourite hiding spot and offered my blankie to the television set saying "Here daddy, you can have my blankie, you don't have to be cold!" The adults thought that was the sweetest, funniest thing ever, but to my four year old mind, my father was suffering and I wanted to help. I knew he was pretending, but could I be really, really sure he wasn't actually cold?

This was the most recent occasion where I've discovered that my memory has improved or embellished an original. The usual trend with memory is that things fall out.

My own aesthetic sense papers over the failings and produces a fine gloss on what might really be dross.
The implication of preparing to move Russian troops not only is to protect its own vital regional interests but possibly to assist Iran in the event of such an attack. Sources add that a Russian military buildup in the region could result in the Russian military potentially engaging Israeli forces, U.S. forces, or both.

You are transformed into a world where rolling hills, sprawling vineyards, beautiful houses, and quaint villages take over. From lunch with a traditional Italian family to cooking pasta, visiting shops selling ham, cured meats and cheese, tasting wines and visiting a local factory making pasta, Antonio and Gennaro keeps you entertained with their wit and humour in Bologna- their first stop. Next they move on to the South of Italy to the Amalfi coast, where Gennaro grew up. Personally this was the most favourite episode for me. Cooking by the sea side, plucking fresh lemons off the trees and biting into them, preparing a linguine dish on a boat using fresh octopus and mussels which Gennaro collected after his diving expedition and the wit and humour the two Italians share among themselves were absolutely fun to watch. Ah! the ricotta and lemon tart they made in this episode still holds fresh in my memory. Its high up there on my to-make list.

It was a simple chance event on a London underground station that got me thinking about luck, chance and randomness and led many years later to my new novel, Wasted. It wasn't an earth-shattering event but it got me thinking. Obsessively. So, I began a novel for adults - I'd two unpublished ones languishing already - about chance, quantum mechanics, and unpredictability, involving repeated multiple possibilities. The idea was that if there is a god - which I know there isn't - he will either play dice or at least have a lot of fun observing. But halfway through, a completely different idea hit me, this time for teenagers. I abandoned god and quantum

Charming landscaping. Flanked by a community mosque on one side and the Karachi residence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi on the other, Hilal Park stretches over a hillock. The landscape design, which makes exceptional use of the topography, is the highlight of the Park. A brick path, edged with immaculately pruned topiaries weaves through well-maintained, exotically shaped flower beds, up a hill, and over culverts and wooden bridges that span over the narrow ravines in the rock formations.

I went to the front desk and explained what happened and luckily they did give us a room (it would have been a long trip home!). We got the same type of room, same rate, but it was a handicapped accessible room. They probably hold those rooms back in case they are needed. I don't know yet if I got charged for our missed night. I had reserved the room with a card that I subsequently canceled (due to fraud). So I don't know if they would have been able to charge it or not.

Deep in to the first thirty minutes or so of the chick flick and I found myself thinking about story. Just the word and what it means. It was during the scenes in which the graduated "It" girls arrived in Abu Dhabi that my mind began to wander. You see this is where I noticed the story that had pulled me in during the first half hour shifted its focus from story telling to showiness. Somewhere, someone must have stated that the second installment of the movie must be bigger or needed more, I'll use Ms. Bradshaw's word, "sparkle" than its predecessor. Yeah I get it, in a vast sea of sequels they had to dream up some way for theirs to standout, but along the way they forgot about story. And how a well written, relatable tale can pull in and take hold of an audience every time.
After compiling a passel of such non-animation and not exclusively cartoon images, I have decided to launch them on their own blog: "Pacific SplendorLAnd", where they will not interfere with the winnowing but still vaguely animation-related ramblings here.The main thing I have enjoyed about doing these pieces is that they wind up being singular, self-contained compositions, as opposed to quick fragmented doodles on the one end of the spectrum; or artwork created as a stream of storytelling devices, such as a storyboard or an animation sequence on the other. So somehow this makes them want their own blog.

The biggest thing is with Oldest and her boyfriends daughter, who's 3. The mom just up and left for the 4th time, leaving the daughter with Oldest and Boyfriend. No contact for over a month! Oldest and Boyfriend went to a lawyer to see what they could do, and the lawyer said NOTHING. Yep, nothing. A judge in our county won't rule against a mom who has several domestic violence charges called to her home, who has pulled a gun on her current boyfriend several times, has a mental illness, and has had several attempted suicides!
Given NuLabour's visceral hatred and contempt for the white working class, who's interests so often conflicts with those now much preferred groups, many observers would have assumed that Denham was either making a bad joke and had forgotten the punchline, or was suffering from some catastrophic mental breakdown, had they, that is, not realised that an election is imminent.
It's also not clear how much we should cheer the 64.6 percent increase in the number of Black-owned non-employer firms. Average revenues at these firms dropped 10.7 percent in real terms between 2002 and 2007. Perhaps more importantly, in 2007 the average revenue at a Black-owned non-employer firm was only $18,500 (in 2002 dollars).

Her father finds this promise restrictive and only agrees if she makes a promise as well. She has to procure Abram a son and heir or else Abram's promise is null and void. Sarai is confident that she can keep up her end of the deal, so she agrees.

Yet let us analyze these implications in their general form. Starting with an increase in extreme weather, the erosion of soils and weak rock will increase. This will cause more of the imposing landmasses to crumble into the sea leading to an even greater rise in sea level. The changes will exponentially become more and more unpredictable. A chaotic patter will emerge which can never be studied. People will panic, but the plain fact is that nature is beyond their control. Sea levels will rise, temperatures will spike, and weather will be out of control. Everything will seem to be pointing toward an inevitable apocalypse.
You know how sometimes you just feel grouchy as all get-out? For no reason? Sure, if you're female and somewhere between puberty and the end of menopause, you can blame it on hormones. Actually, you can blame it on hormones at any time--even if you're a guy. "It's andropause! I swear! I didn't mean to shoot your truck!"
No matter how funky things get, Withers plays it cool . We've all probably heard "Lean On Me" too many times by now. But next time, listen to the song in the context of all the gospel soul that was hitting the charts in 1972: Aretha Franklin's Young Gifted And Black and Amazing Grace, The Staple Sisters's "I'll Take You There", Jesus Christ Superstar. The Rolling Stones's "Let It Loose" and "Shine A Light"? Could the compassionate singer be JC himself?
Now, I don't want to sound like I'm crapping on the whole movie, because I actually did enjoy it. I think they did some perfect casting with Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades. They are two of my favorite actors, and I can't think of any two people more perfect for those two roles. I also have a huge crush on the ruggedly handsome Sam Worthington, and Mads Mikkelson is pretty much great in everything he does, and this is no exception. My favorite part of the movie was the whole Medusa scene. From Io explaining the Medusa backstory to Perseus cutting off her head, it is amazing! Its nuts because they all survive these giant ass scorpions, and the three witches (also a cool scene.."a sacrifice!"), but they all drop like flies when it comes to Medusa. She doesn't even have to do anything. She looks at you...you die. End of story.

Seems to be the case that for some reason, the Left (as I'll call them here), have been brainwashed into thinking the EDL are a violent Nazi group.

This is a unique album, wedged between the previous 'Glam-esque' releases (although to be fair, Big Beat was starting to head towards a more American sound), and prior to their full blown move to the Euro Electronic sound. By the mid 70's, Sparks were pretty big all over Europe (particularly in Britain), and the band were keen to make inroads in their own backyard, so this album was to take on the US market - even the title seems geared to their prospective new audience, although knowing their wicked sense of humour, it was more likely just a piss take title for their seventh album! I asked Russell and Ron to spill the beans on how they ended up with it, they told me "We just felt it a propos to title our 7th album Introducing Sparks. Most bands don't name their 7th album 'introducing'. That's probably what appealed to us. In fact, most bands don't even have a 7th album!".

Covey amplifies his message by means of wide-ranging examples of "third alternative thinkers". There's the local police force that transformed a crime-plagued community by casting off its entrenched "them against us" mentality. Another example tells the tale of a father who, during the course of one extraordinary evening, rescued his daughter from years of clinical depression. Then there's the judge who brought a swift and peaceful end to a massive environmental lawsuit without setting foot in a courtroom.

It has also been suggested that local communities should be given the right to buy up closed pubs and run them themselves. This may work in close-knit villages in the Lake District, but it's unlikely to be of much interest to the neighbours of large urban pubs like the Four Heatons or the Southern Hotel. The most likely result if some kind of "cooling off period" is introduced for people to try to raise the money to buy them is pubs remaining closed and blighted for months with no realistic prospect of ever coming back to life. In general, local communities are more likely to want developers to get on with it and build a block of flats or a supermarket as soon as possible.

Kaputt is a total curveball from an artist who had previously been in danger of settling too comfortably into a familiar style. Dan Bejar's albums as Destroyer had been yielding diminishing returns in recent years, and it had begun to seem like he was going to keep mining the same basic territory until everyone who once loved his quirky, urbane, complex pop grew bored of the stagnation. Instead, he's turned to an out-of-favor style from the past, swathing his songs in reverb-heavy lite-jazz and balearic pop atmospheres, recalling the crude synth presets and shimmering, plastic production of early 80s radio pop. It's a daring reinvention, and what initially might seem like a gimmick soon reveals itself, over multiple listens, as a brilliant aesthetic maneuver. Bejar's usually spiky voice is smoothed out to fit the glistening musical backdrops, and the album glides by so effortlessly that Bejar's characteristic wit has a chance to sneak up on the listener for once. The music is sad and sweet, and there's a lonely nostalgic feeling built into Bejar's trip to the musical past. Horns echo within the mix, surrounded with reverb to impart a feeling of distance, as though the trumpeter is miles away, intoning lonely notes into a void. Bejar is taking music often thought of as kitschy and dated and reconstructing it as haunting downer pop, revealing the loneliness and emptiness lurking behind the party gloss and disco gleam. Because of the subtlety of it all, and the initial impression of surface slickness, it's a real grower of an album that only parcels out its secrets slowly, gradually accumulating emotional depth and intensity until the kitschy surface style seems like the most natural possible way of capturing these dark, secret feelings.

Roger Webster, who gives a rather simplistic view of the historical facts in his bedside book - "The Illustrated at the Fireside - Pg 56", gives some insight into how it came about that the British press of that time managed to frame Hermanus Potgieter as a rogue and a villain. At that time the Volksraad of the Transvaal had passed a law prohibiting barter with the local people, under a penalty of £37.10. The object of the law ---- now listen carefully, ---- was to keep the peace! The fact that someone was going to make lots of money was beside the point!
So I pondered and scratched out various possibilities, and casually read through various texts by and about Che or Abe, wondering what the most suggestive, poetic and concise way of connecting these two men across time and history could be, until one day I hit on something that I just knew was right. It was a quote, by Che, in reference to his trip to New York City in 1964 to address the United Nations' General Assembly. It seems that while he was in New York there were two attempts on his life, one by a man wielding a gun and one by a woman with a knife. When asked about these attacks by a journalist, he is said to have responded with a smile and a bemused wisecrack: "It is better to be killed by a woman with a knife than a man with a gun" said Che.

It is nearly impossible to engender the necessary confidence, trust and loyalty a leader must possess without being fully engaged. A leader spends as much time out of the confines of the office engaging in real conversation with people as they do in their office planning, decision-making and organizing. Whether in person, over the phone, via email, through the social web, or even by sending a good old fashion "thank you" note - be an engaging conversationalist.

J had an egg scramble with bacon, mushroom and sausage which also looked good. It was a lovely cosy atmosphere with little booths and squishy chairs. The meal for both of us, with 3 drinks, was only $30 which was great.
I do agree that the overgrown man-child figure in films can be very annoying, but I also don't like the fact we live an a society that worships 'maturity.' Yes, it's important that adults should be capable of earning money, supporting themselves and not behaving like pre-socialisation children (there's a reason all our parents/caregivers taught us the lesson 'If you aren't nice, people won't like you.' Because, seriously, they won't). Note that I said 'capable' - sadly in today's economy, too many people can't do some of these things, through no fault of their own, or temporarily choose not to, to pursue other goals.

Whenever our right becomes the guiding factor of our lives, it dulls our spiritual insight. The greatest enemy of the life of faith in God is not sin, but good choices which are not quite good enough. The good is always the enemy of the best. In this passage, it would seem that the wisest thing in the world for Abram to do would be to choose. It was his right, and the people around him would consider him to be a fool for not choosing.

You see, New Years Eve dinner was kind of the beginning of my birthday celebrations, because all those years ago, my mother was in labour that night.. giving birth to me 5 hours after midnight. a New Years day baby. this day, 54 years ago, I was preparing to come into the world. Each New Years Eve, I would wear a new dress and party shoes.. feeling very much a princess. I felt special because of Peter's hospitality

It's been a while - since December, in fact - since I pulled out the brew equipment. Well, with the return of summer, and my recently purchased, though not yet assembled MLT, the time has come to make some beer.

Here's a quick run down.

This year tested that faith. There is no way around it: This was a lousy year in sports. Scandal. Disgrace. Crime. The horror in and around sports rose to previously unimagined depths -- the empire struck back, the dark side reigned. Penn State dominated the news, but there were charges elsewhere, in too many places, in Miami and Ohio State and Syracuse and, well, who could keep up? Players went on strike. Owners locked out. Fan favorites left town. Legends went on trial. Concussions. Perjury. PEDs.

Maybe Facebook should hire Thomas Friedman to do its ads. His ad for Coursera (h/t Indyanna's comment at Historiann's) column on online education pretty much explains why the 100,000-person online class and the flipped classroom, with local professors as glorified tutors, is the way to go. The comments are good, and they ask the same questions we've all been asking and come to some similar conclusions.
For this also there is no technological or large-scale solution. Perhaps, as they believe, the most conscientiously up-to-date people can easily do without local workshops and stores, local journalism, a local newspaper, a local post office, all of which supposedly have been replaced by technologies. But what technology can replace personal privacy or the coherence of a family or a community? What technology can undo the collateral damages of an inhuman rate of technological change?

Labour making gains at the government's expense - it was expected and is not unusual for local elections around half-way through a government's life. Under the Thatcher government this used to happen quite often yet the lady went on to lead her party to victory several times.

All edges were coloured with Memento green dye ink applied with cut'n'dry foam. The bottom panels were first trimmed out of Kraft card and then matted with the pink paper.and stuck in place as shown. The main panel on the plaque was put together similarly but before attaching was stamped with a moth stamp (PaperArtsy) in Archival black ink and embellished with a diecut (Nestabilities) tag with pink panel and another 'Smile' stamp (PaperArtsy). The roses were applied at the base on foam pads. A piece of 3 mm dark green satin ribbon was tied through the hole in the tag and a piece of black numbers Washi tape applied before sticking in place.

I started with Indus, an IPA. It looked to be pouring a bit flat and it took a bit of coaxing to get a loose-bubbled head to form on the top. It didn't last long. However the beer really benefits from the low carbonation as it creates a wonderful cask-like effect, with just enough sparkle to push the flavours out. Naturally enough, it's hops out front: good honest English varieties by the taste of them, with lots of floral orange blossom laid on quite intensely, creating almost a resinous burn while staying clean and crisp, avoding all harshness. At 4.6% ABV it's around a percentage point weaker than the likes of White Shield and Bengal Lancer, but I'd regard it as being very much in the same league. The balance of marmalade and toffee you get in the others isn't present here, but the hop punchiness makes up for it for me. Tangy, sinkable and with a lasting bitterness, I really enjoyed it.

"Our results suggest that long-term meditators have white-matter fibers that are either more numerous, more dense or more insulated throughout the brain," Dr. Luders said in a statement to the media. "We also found that the normal age-related decline of white-matter tissue is considerably reduced in active meditation practitioners."
When one adds to this the fact that the arts are not only an economic multiplier, but also a social and cultural multiplier in an economy in which jobs are becoming even less and less interesting, it can make more sense to implement arts support schemes than it does in periods when the work ethic seems to be operating at its full volume.

It's all well and good to shit on Myst and everything, but I just have a real love of exploring strange spaces. STALKER, for instance, was less about shooting shit for me and more about finding weird old soviet structures warped by strange radiation. Same with Fallout. Looking at something in the distance and finding out why it's there is just super cool. Like archaeology but with the boring edited out.

It is relatively obvious that certain international business pursuits are more likely to influence environmental conditions. These types of businesses need to be especially concerned about the fashion in which they conduct business. They must assure citizens that the environment will not be tarnished for decades to come. I have no qualms about them facilitating business in an international setting, but they need to make sure that the environment doesn't become degraded as a result of their organizational operations.

It is difficult to make a living from writing. I haven't cracked it yet, although I can see my income growing as I get more interest from foreign publishers and - crucially - manage to keep on producing books. If I compare it, though, to my career in journalism, I'm quite happy. Although I could earn considerably more with a staff job on a national newspaper (and they aren't any easier to come by than getting a book deal), my salary would be pretty much my limit. Whereas a book..well, anything could happen. It's possible for a book to earn for you again and again - a foreign sale here, a film deal there - while you're working on other stuff.
But going down through the water to touch the wild man at the bottom of the pond is quite a different matter. The being who stands up is frightening, and he seems even more so now, when corporations do so much work to produce the sanitized, hairless shallow man (2) That's poor Viggo in THE ROAD, a sanitized man re-bearded, trying to be wild in a wild land, having to re-learn the role of the deep, dark masculine and getting it incorrect. No reflection on Viggo, of course, who showed he can bring that shit hardcore in the RINGS films and HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. It's more I think the head-on craftsmanshippy approach to the McCarthy novel -- it gets it too right, maybe, to work. Teardrop on the other hand is the untamed wild man, the kind of guy that creeps you out at first but then somewhere along the way, not sure when, you start to admire him. Isn't that so much better, children, than the other way around? (Beards of Bleakness: WINTER'S BONE VS. THE ROAD)

Personally, I am a fan of books like this that help bridge the gap to help children graduate from reading Bible picture books to actually digesting Scripture. And while it is not a homeschool "curriculum", it would certainly adapt well as a Bible curriculum, especially if your family enjoys the New Living Translation. On the other hand, children this age are incredibly impressionable. They are thinking and absorbing so much. It is time to sharpen up on your theology. I have read some Bible storybooks where the stories are retold in a way that uses soft theology or even sways the story by adding (or omitting) details to the original text. The mere fact that someone picks and chooses only certain Bible stories to retell means that the person has at least some control of what the final presentation looks like. In this book, Carolyn Larsen has condensed the Scripture to retell each story, but (as you can see from the one example above) she is merely eliminating details that may cause a young brain (or even my old brain) to scatter and wander. It brings the story focus, and keeps the truth. Larsen has taken the opportunity to use the "Now What" section to tie in the big picture of the Gospel right from the beginning. For me, this is an essential element that I look for in a good book. One of the first things I did was flip to the back of the book to the stories telling of Jesus' death and resurrection and the early church. I read through the "Now What" sections looking for any details that may tell my child how or why to become saved. At first, it appeared that I wouldn't find what I was looking for. Disappointed, I flipped to Genesis. There it was. With the telling of Adam and Eve's sin, came the Gospel. Right at the beginning, exactly where it was needed. We need a Savior and here's why and here is where you can find Him.

The key to this entire problem was failure to understand Paul's ministry and message. Were Lysius to side with the Jews, he would be as lost as they. Fortunately, he had Paul in a semi-private audience. The Jews no longer had a gospel message for God was no longer dealing with them. To Paul was given the gospel of the grace of God for so we read in Ephesians 3:2.

Billy slowly drove into Casey's driveway, and although she had been through a night of fear and terror, she felt nothing other than happiness and joy when she saw her house. It looked like heaven to Casey because she wasn't even sure if she would live to see daylight. Casey slung open the truck door and jumped out of Billy's truck in lightening speed. As she ran up to the driver's side and softly said "I know exactly what happened last night, Billy. You guys drugged me and raped me. And I will never forget it. You're going to get away with it because I am too ashamed to tell anyone what you guys did to me. You can bet your ass that God will avenge my honor. You may not go to jail, but you will suffer for what you did to me." Billy looked at her, and he was completely stunned that she remembered what had happened. This is probably due to, the fact that they gave her what they thought was a drug that would make her forget. Evidently, the effects weren't as potent as Billy had hoped.
We stood outside their house and hugged and prayed over them. I held each of them tight until they cried. They needed a mother's love and protection and the feel of safet, if only for a moment. I kissed them all over their faces and told them I loved them and we would see them again, and help them in the meantime. Isabelle and Johnny begged to give them all the food we had in the van, so we asked them to walk back with us. We walked down that path to the van, praying the whole way. I didn't know until later that night after looking at the pictures that we were all holding hands. Isabelle and Johnny love these girls too, and their hearts were broken and changed that day too.

The last time I went to Las Vegas was seven years ago when I only visited for a choral directors conference with four other students who had little to no interest in eating anywhere that cost more than $5 or attending any shows and I didn't really think it would be a good idea for me to traipse around the Strip, alone. Sometimes I make really good decisions.

I had never seen so many hippies in one place outside Central Park. We were all over the grounds and buildings, setting up tents and campsites outdoors and inside, utilizing the communal kitchen, and playing together everywhere. Perhaps what amazed me most during that week was how careful we were to keep the place clean, how nothing was trashed or damaged, how all of us were committed to leaving the grounds as we'd found them or even better.

The first instant of cold as he embraced Clearsight was welcome, refreshing, numbing to the anxiety of being so far in conflict with the Wildren. It didn't last; the cold sharpened, pushed hard fingers through the centre of his forehead, and pain returned. At least he stayed distracted from worrying about Dora and Taslin. Even without the pressure between his eyes, the room revealed by his enhanced vision made sure of that.

Seems to be the case that for some reason, the Left (as I'll call them here), have been brainwashed into thinking the EDL are a violent Nazi group. My experience is that it's the UAF that are against free speech, human rights and are willing to let this country go to the dogs! If you believe in democracy, why do you protest at anybody else's parade, demo or whatever?

I've really enjoyed watching the team play this season. These are the five seniors on the team. The team is only allowed to send one gal to the individual singles and one team to doubles. Caroline (on the right) is playing in the singles match today - she is seeded #5 in the state! The gal on her right - Kelsie - is playing doubles today. The doubles team is seeded #2.
So end our readers' tributes to Hitch. As I expect many of you have been doing, I've spent quite a few hours over the last two weeks watching videos of Christopher in debate, giving talks, or taking down pompous talking heads on television. I could recommend my favorites, but suggest instead that you just find a random one and follow the YouTube links. You will be impressed: for someone who talked so often, he rarely repeated himself, and everything he said sounded fresh. We have nobody to replace this man, but, thank Ceiling Cat, he left us a legacy of not only his writings and the example of his courage, but also the visual record of his eloquence and incessant fight for the truth.
So anyway, let's leave structuralism and return to the hippie journalist. There's another thought thread that she presented that I want to explore.

Our personal psychology is how our karmic patterns show up in this lifetime. A general Buddhist or Hindu perspective on karma suggests that the individual soul moves through consciousness lifetime after lifetime, incarnating again and again in the school of life in order to complete various tasks and lessons, and to release contractions of consciousness.

The yellow shoes I made were turned, literally. Made inside out, then flipped. The outer sole is stitched directly to the uppers. This style is around and fashionable for all of our time period. It is the least durable, since it cannot be re-soled and has to have a thinner sole to be able to be turned. However, this makes it the daintiest of shoe styles.

It has also been suggested that local communities should be given the right to buy up closed pubs and run them themselves. This may work in close-knit villages in the Lake District, but it's unlikely to be of much interest to the neighbours of large urban pubs like the Four Heatons or the Southern Hotel. The most likely result if some kind of "cooling off period" is introduced for people to try to raise the money to buy them is pubs remaining closed and blighted for months with no realistic prospect of ever coming back to life. In general, local communities are more likely to want developers to get on with it and build a block of flats or a supermarket as soon as possible.

In my seemingly never-ending quest to find the best, most user-friendly, flexible, non-annoying, and free collaborative workspace in which to share ideas and data with a particular large research team, I recently set up some trial workspaces using various platforms. I didn't want to send out invitations to the entire group until I decided which, if any, we would be using, so I only added one guinea-pig colleague, just to test things out.
I do owe you guys an apologie, for not responding, reacting or following your blogs. It's not that i don't want to, but this project is time and energy consuming, so i don't take the time to either comment or write a simple thank you. So i take the opportunity now to tell you, that it's highly appreciated that you follow my blog and read about a project like this.and actually liking it :-p

Even though it's not the end, it's fitting that today's Friday Update deals exclusively with ends. More specifically, savage backsides; superior posteriors made extra savage through hard, heavy training. And today of all days is an explosion of gluteal savagery, booty awesomeness, and asses that just plain go POW. Huge thanks to all the contributors, such as Lift Big Eat Big, and all you savage, savage ladies who helped make today a Callipygian Cornucopia.

It's unfair to you because you may not be aware of what you are signing up for, in which case, you may host their advertisements for free without making any money. Whether or not it's ethical to post editorial content that you may make money off of is really up for grabs at this point in the blogopshere. I personally feel uncomfortable about placing advertisements in my blog unless they are clearly marked.
I followed my parent's home, even though they weren't aware of my presense. My mom wept all the way while my dad remained silent. He begged my mom to calm down but it all fell on deaf ears. We got home to find the house filled with friends and relatives, my Dad carried my body and laid it on the mat in the living room. Prayers for forgiveness were said, and my parents were advised to stop crying as it wouldn't bring me back. I watched my Mom cry and weep all night as she asked God why He Had to take my life.

The biggest thing is with Oldest and her boyfriends daughter, who's 3. The mom just up and left for the 4th time, leaving the daughter with Oldest and Boyfriend. No contact for over a month! Oldest and Boyfriend went to a lawyer to see what they could do, and the lawyer said NOTHING. Yep, nothing. A judge in our county won't rule against a mom who has several domestic violence charges called to her home, who has pulled a gun on her current boyfriend several times, has a mental illness, and has had several attempted suicides!

Step 2 - Drop and Bake: Drop batter by tablespoon onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in a well pre-heated 350º F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Do not over-bake. Cookies should be a bit gooey in the center. While warm, they will be very soft on the outside, as well. Allow them to cool on the pan a few minutes and then transfer carefully to a rack to finish cooling. (They will always be somewhat soft because these are gooey fudge brownie cookies, not hard or crunchy cookies.)
To maintain: To maintain your starter, try to feed it at least once a week, although it can go for a month or longer. The starter may have a substantial layer of green, grey, or brown liquid on the top and that is okay; it is simply alcohol from the fermenting yeast.

And what did he do with his deadly darts,
One thing I have noticed after watching a number of these space shows is that unless you're watching a live feed from the space station, nobody can make a space show about ANY planet or moon without mentioning and showing digitally rendered footage, at least four times in an hour-long show, of a huge asteroid hitting the Earth and wiping out our entire existence. They're obsessed. Though I feel that the obsession probably has more to do with sensationalism to boost ratings than an obsession with the end of the world as we know it. The way they work that scenario into every show smacks of the sensationalism used to get people to watch the news every night. Jackasses.
Though I'm sure it doesn't sound like it, I have gotten over quite a bit of my aggression and I've learned to forgive but I just simply won't forget. I realize the "what ifs" and regrets are pointless. I've even developed relationships with the people who hurt me and I'm able to look past what I consider to be their mistakes because in the end, regardless of what that one day meant, we are happy and no one can take that away from us.

Liverworts, like mosses contain no vascular systems to transport water and nutrients throughout the plant. This means they are most likely to be found in damp shady locations. Not surprisingly, wherever you find liverworts, there is bound to be mosses as well. Although liverwort like shade, they also require enough sunlight to conduct photosynthesis.

But, "We remain cautious about pronouncing a turnaround until we observe a couple more quarters of improvement," said Reis. "As we have observed in the recent past, two consecutive quarters of improvement are not necessarily the beginning of a trend and are insufficient to declare that a recovery is underway."

Monday was so nice. I got up later than I had on the trip, but earlier than usual for me. I lazed around all day, catching up on tv shows that I had missed while I was gone, and catching up on a few things online. It was so nice to have air conditioning, electricity, my computer, my phone, and my bed. All things that I missed on the trip.
I was lunching at Gaylords (still there, and still terrific) in Fitzrovia with two contacts, and we were one of just four tables occupied. Afterwards, I strolled round the restaurant-packed area and spoke to some owners. Two admitted they didn't think they'd make it through next year unless things looked up. All said their Christmas bookings were well down before around December 15th. What seemed to be depressing most of them was the total absence of any sign of improvement.
Well here is the first interview I've ever carried out - with Louis Abbott from Admiral Fallow.
I've mentioned many reasons for having "photowednesdays" on this blog. some reasons are current events love of Brooklyn and keeping my idle hands from being the devils playthings. I've probably also mentioned it's not always easy to find a new pic of something Brooklyn-centric or born that's interesting. I never want photo Wednesdays to turn into a catalogue of cliched pics of the bridge or the arch.

WEALTHY FAMILIES: The first is wealthy families where the older generation has retired or is nearing retirement. Typically, their income is secure and they're concerned primarily with wealth protection and transfer. Agents may find that these wealthy families can take underutilized or under-performing assets and convert them to a permanent life insurance policy, often with the added advantage of a LTC rider. This strategy helps secure their wealth and makes it possible to pass on their assets to heirs in a tax-advantaged way, as well as assuring their long-term security if they need care.

Now, "making an example" of someone, to me, is the stuff of wartime prison camps. Not civil courts in peacetime. You cannot reasonably over-punish a high-visibility convict to deter those who might follow. Not fair. Nor, of course, could punishment by proxy be justified, supposing it were provable. Fact is, though, that a young man who clearly has some problems is being locked in with people who are more likely to supplement his trauma than to show him the way to enlightenment. And we are paying for it. I would say that the law is an ass. But I don't want to be in contempt of court, do I?
Fuck cellphones. How the fuck do we think we're ever going to stay on this planet if we keep pumping so much shit into cellphones. You know what they're doing, right? They're making it so our entire life can be carried on one tiny fucking handheld thing. Imagine that. A monopoly on life itself. I'm waiting for the day when cellphones actually spew out Starbucks coffee. It'll happen. It'll fuckin' HAPPEN. You'd figure with all these amazing additions to portable communication, they'd actually make a phone that could fuckin' work as a PHONE!

Come to think of it, there's really no difference between Mandela and Taylor. Mandela supporters terrorized the black majority into electing him president in 1994, after South Africa had been at war against communist forces since the mid-1960's. Taylor, following a peace deal that ended the Liberian Civil War, also terrorized the population into electing him president in the 1997 general election.
TMT, developed over 20 years ago by social psychologists, explains how humans come to cope with death anxiety by developing self-esteem and attributing purpose to life. However, we do this by shoring up our own cultural identities, self-esteem, and frankly become more conservative in the way that we view others who might threaten our world view. So while Dark Tourism might make us feel all the better about being alive, it may make us less tolerant of others which just seems so counter-intuitive.

Making dumplings is a great way to get over that after-work slump of forgoing the dinner plans and diving into a bag of microwave popcorn (I fully admit to having done this), because even though it takes awhile, it's pretty easy, and I felt like a kid in science class watching an experiment! These two dough logs blow up and get all slimy in a big pot of boiling water. Don't worry, the slime subsides by the time they're ready to eat :)

As we approached Shoreditch, I spotted this building. I couldn't see a date on it but it looks Victorian. A deliciously extravagant design, this pub was once called Ye Olde Axe but the name has been painted over and the swinging sign has all but lost its paintwork. The building looks neglected and in need of repair, like something out of a Gothic horror film. An illuminated sign on the side reads "Striptease". Unsurprisingly, the clock no longer works. It is very sad to see buildings like this being allowed to fall into a state of neglected disrepair.
Even more importantly I think I'm having a rebirth of my spirit. For the longest time I've basically just existed. I've done the bare minimum around the house. It's been a struggle to get that done too. But the last few weeks I've been WANTING to spread my wings and take the time to make the homemade breads and the homemade snacks. I've been wanting to do that stuff. It's almost like I'm being reborn. I don't know what has brought this about. I'm afraid to blink...afraid that it will go away if I do. I still have all the stress and depression in my life....but I'm really trying to not let it affect ME. And maybe that's the whole difference.

Established in 1892, CILEx was known as the Institute of Legal Executives (ILEX) in 1963 before changing its name in January 2012 when it received a royal charter. According to CILEx, 81.5 per cent of its members have parents who studied at university. Only 2 per cent of members have a lawyer for a parent. Clearly, CILEx operates in different circles from the magic-circle law firms, which have attracted criticism in the past for using the old boys' network of recruitment.

As the nightly program wound through several non-college football segments, Dunlaw reflected on the surreal nature of his situation: "I still can't believe Herbie's sleeping with my Tracy.

The Bush Conspiracy Theory is a Lie. If neither flight was in the air as American Airlines itself has so stated, then numerous 'official versions' of the 'official conspiracy theory' are but a pack of malicious lies. There is, then, probable cause to indict Bush and his co-conspirators for the crimes of mass murder and high treason. See: U. S. Codes, Title 18, Section 2441. That includes every statement made by Bush.
Thus, no doubt soon you will probly hear soon some business leaders or pretend potential self-appointed communist leaders lamenting the lack of organization of the #Occupy movements, describing them as "in choate" (which is a kind of wide penis with no head), or "udderless," or "lacking discernible goals" (like Sporting Gijon). What they are really mean is that there is a ferment of new ideas that therefore could be dangerous and must be curtailed, or at least curtopped. After all, nobody has any idea where a march that goes nowhere might end up. If these peoples weren't too feckless to emigrate we could at least lure them onto a ferry with the promise of jobs in Australia and transport them there. We would never hear of them ever again! But while they are there, in the midst of ordinary, heads-down, knees-back God-fearing punters, fermenting theories without limitations and trying out new processes, such as democracy-never a positive development-they constitute a threat to our docile, passive, obedient way of life. They must be stomped on by square-headed baton-wielding riot police, preferably from up the country, before any new ideas seep out into the public body at large, like a ball of ideological pus.

On days that I need to complete a lot I will set my timer for 15 minutes and work on one task for the full 15 minutes. I will stop that task when the timer goes off and move on to another task. This usually happens on good days, where the pain is tolerable. I will work on one task, for example, clearing clutter in one room, then I move to 15 minutes doing computer work, then 15 minutes cleaning a focus zone, then 15 minutes reading. I try to alternate from something physical to something sedentary, and including a 15 minute "break" every third 15 minute session. This is what I call my 15 minute day, and I find that I am most productive these days.
As a parent of two children myself, as a wife, and as a daughter of a cancer survivor, I could not simply just leave my "facebook words of support" and be done with it. Mark and his family are in for a long, tough road ahead and I think we all should chip in and help. I am appealing to the Atheist community, especially, since we are always accused of being "sinful" and "immoral" without "god" in our lives, but I am also appealing to all the human beings out there who know that we are one human family and that by helping eachother, even if that other person is a stranger, we are, in essence, making this world a better place for ourselves and for our children especially.

At around dusk, Emi asked if I wanted to go for a walk in the woods, and of course I said yes. We picked up a friend of hers on the way. It rained this afternoon, and everything had that fresh, sweet smell that you always get after rain in the spring time. The Peepers were deafening as we picked our way through the slick mud, over wet rocks, and through damp grasses, fending off mosquitoes as we went. Emi tried to catch a frog (it was brown, though we're not sure what type it was.) as we wound our way through the flooded areas, looking for peepers and other frogs. We saw the colour of the sky through the trees as the sun set.

For my last couple of essays for the Sequart site, seen here and here, I critiqued a COMIC BOOK RESOURCES essay from Kelly Thompson entitled "No, It's Not Equal," which is probably representative of this tendency. The essay garnered (as of today) a more than respectable number of comments, a whopping 473 in all. By my incomplete perusal, the reply-thread was marked by an awful lot of people declaiming their beliefs on one side or the other in the most strident of tones. Possibly a better title for the thread itself would've been the one Heidi McDonald used for a BEAT topic on Dave Sim: "The One With All the Comments."

I followed my parent's home, even though they weren't aware of my presense. My mom wept all the way while my dad remained silent. He begged my mom to calm down but it all fell on deaf ears. We got home to find the house filled with friends and relatives, my Dad carried my body and laid it on the mat in the living room. Prayers for forgiveness were said, and my parents were advised to stop crying as it wouldn't bring me back. I watched my Mom cry and weep all night as she asked God why He Had to take my life.

Executive summary: Guys and Dolls
Billy slowly drove into Casey's driveway, and although she had been through a night of fear and terror, she felt nothing other than happiness and joy when she saw her house. It looked like heaven to Casey because she wasn't even sure if she would live to see daylight. Casey slung open the truck door and jumped out of Billy's truck in lightening speed. As she ran up to the driver's side and softly said "I know exactly what happened last night, Billy. You guys drugged me and raped me. And I will never forget it. You're going to get away with it because I am too ashamed to tell anyone what you guys did to me. You can bet your ass that God will avenge my honor. You may not go to jail, but you will suffer for what you did to me." Billy looked at her, and he was completely stunned that she remembered what had happened.

Established in 1892, CILEx was known as the Institute of Legal Executives (ILEX) in 1963 before changing its name in January 2012 when it received a royal charter. According to CILEx, 81.5 per cent of its members have parents who studied at university. Only 2 per cent of members have a lawyer for a parent. Clearly, CILEx operates in different circles from the magic-circle law firms, which have attracted criticism in the past for using the old boys' network of recruitment.
I learned about Oh My Melodies from Espousal Records' Kyoungmo Kim as he updated me on the current whereabouts of the members of emo pop band I Love JH.

A movie like Red Tails which narrates the lives of such upstanding historical figures are exactly what the African-American society wants to see in the Big Screen.

But it's not. Most school chicken nuggets have at least a zillion ingredients. Okay, I exaggerate. Maybe they have thirty-five. Modified corn starch, soy, beef extract and maltodextrin - among other things - are not something I'd want any human to have in moderation. The same goes for cupcakes. I'm not against cake, and I'm not against most traditions. Just the last two weekends I let my son sing happy birthday and consume cake. But it was my choice. I was there to be his "judgment," and he ate confections. But I also know he's not likely to eat cake for another whole year. The birthdays for the February 2010 babies from my mommy groups are all done, and so is the cake. I don't have to worry about every neighborhood parent running down to the local grocery and bringing a sugar, corn syrup and white flour treat right to his preschool desk.
Next, write down all the skills you need to learn or to work on. If you are just getting started with writing, you may find this difficult. If people have made comments on your writing, you can use those comments to make your list. If, for instance, you have been told that your characters are not believable or your descriptions fuzzy, then the skills of creating characters and writing description go on your list. Or try this: read over a piece of writing by your favorite author, writing you consider excellent. Now write down all the things the writer does that make this piece so good. How many of these things can you do now? How many of them do you need to learn how to do?

Another website says that "as a result, many people nowadays suffer from the over-acidification of their body, also known as acidosis." In addition, they claim that "symptoms of a pH imbalance can be weight problems such as overweight and underweight, as well as other health conditions such as allergies, arthritis, acne and heart attacks."
Almost the exact middle, actually. Young and school-trained London singer Woon's debut album, Mirrorwriting, sits between Katy B and James B, pop theatricality and singer-songwriter calm, club culture and bedroom indie, old-school soul and modern electronic R&B, extroverted and introverted. And tying it all together is the language of UK bass. His first major single, 2010's justly lauded "Night Air", announced him as one of a number of young English artists for whom garage, and everything that came after, was just another bit of pop language to use. And from the slow-motion jungle syncopations and muted bass blare of "Street" to the stuttering retro-rave breakbeats that drive "Spirits", the computer-assisted Woon makes sorta-pop from the last 20 years of UK dance the way current U.S. guitar kids draw from surf-rock and girl-groups.
So end our readers' tributes to Hitch. As I expect many of you have been doing, I've spent quite a few hours over the last two weeks watching videos of Christopher in debate, giving talks, or taking down pompous talking heads on television. I could recommend my favorites, but suggest instead that you just find a random one and follow the YouTube links. You will be impressed: for someone who talked so often, he rarely repeated himself, and everything he said sounded fresh. We have nobody to replace this man, but, thank Ceiling Cat, he left us a legacy of not only his writings and the example of his courage, but also the visual record of his eloquence and incessant fight for the truth.

It's 1860 in Virginia, and Evvy Chamberlyn is expected to behave in a certain way. She, however, has no intentions of living up to those expectations about how to "dress, speak, and act the part of the proper Southern belle."

I was curious about 14-year-old Evvy.Return of the Great Goddess ~ by Burleigh Muten, 1994
In a frying pan, melt a small pat of butter or margarine, and place the bread slices (mayo and cheese side up) in the pan. Cook until golden brown on the bread side.
Step 2 - Drop and Bake: Drop batter by tablespoon onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in a well pre-heated 350º F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Do not over-bake. Cookies should be a bit gooey in the center. While warm, they will be very soft on the outside, as well. Allow them to cool on the pan a few minutes and then transfer carefully to a rack to finish cooling. (They will always be somewhat soft because these are gooey fudge brownie cookies, not hard or crunchy cookies.)

I've mentioned many reasons for having "photowednesdays" on this blog. some reasons are current events love of Brooklyn and keeping my idle hands from being the devils playthings. I've probably also mentioned it's not always easy to find a new pic of something Brooklyn-centric or born that's interesting. I never want photo Wednesdays to turn into a catalogue of cliched pics of the bridge or the arch.
Then finally, they put me on depakote. I am mentioning this drug by name because I have heard from several other women that they believe depakote was the cause of this for them too, and a doctor at a California University said that he strongly, strongly believes that it gives PCOS to young women. Then I heard that some doctors have been instructed not to prescribe it to women under 40. Depakote won't own up to that and they knowingly let the doctors prescribe it (at least, until recently from what I hear). I don't want to get into who my sources are because I don't want to get anyone in trouble. It's very good for seizures, my brother had to take it for years and it kept him alive, but for Bipolar- not so much.

The Rally Fighter was prototyped in the workshop at the back of the Wareham office, but manufacturing muscle also came from Factory Five Racing, a kit-car company and Local Motors investor located just down the road. Of course, the kit-car business has been around for decades, standing as a proof of concept for how small manufacturing can work in the car industry. Kit cars combine hand-welded steel tube chassis and fiberglass bodies with stock engines and accessories. Amateurs assemble the cars at their homes, which exempts the vehicles from many regulatory restrictions (similar to home-built experimental aircraft). Factory Five has sold about 8,000 kits to date.

Such determination in her work life goes hand in hand with sacrifices in her social life. She often finds herself declining invites to parties or social gatherings in favour of a few more hours sewing or attending a networking event.

The aroma was filled with the recognizable smell of Smith and Cross: strong, funky and full of promise. Of course the molasses was there as well, though I am still not sure if I was smelling the actual molasses or the Smith and Cross. Also, the pineapple spear, which was an utter garnish failure, awkward protuberance that it was, added a bit of undefinable fruitiness to the nose. The first sip was very molasses-y, though the hogo of the rum carried through at the end. You would think that there would be some sweetness in this drink, but it was dry and earthy, with a vague powdery texture that made each sip seem almost chewy. After I increased the bitters, the spices became more detectable on the swallow. The flavors of the molasses were also enhanced by the increase in bitters--the drink seemed sweeter, in that pleasing molasses cookie way, and the flavors in general seemed more balanced. Overall, not bad but not great.
Roger Webster, who gives a rather simplistic view of the historical facts in his bedside book - "The Illustrated at the Fireside - Pg 56", gives some insight into how it came about that the British press of that time managed to frame Hermanus Potgieter as a rogue and a villain. At that time the Volksraad of the Transvaal had passed a law prohibiting barter with the local people, under a penalty of £37.10. The object of the law ---- now listen carefully, ---- was to keep the peace! The fact that someone was going to make lots of money was beside the point!

And I was even happier that I hadn't broken the budget to take them myself.

"The Wallflower" rose to No. 2 on the rhythm-and-blues charts in 1954. As was often the case in those days with records by black performers, a toned-down version was soon recorded by a white singer and found a wider audience: Georgia Gibbs's version, with the title and lyric changed to "Dance With Me, Henry," was a No. 1 pop hit in 1955. (Its success was not entirely bad news for Ms. James. She shared the songwriting royalties with Mr. Ballard and the bandleader and talent scout Johnny Otis, who had arranged for her recording session. (Mr. Otis died on Tuesday.)

It is as through our body, heart and soul simultaneously flower in reverential awe of the moment. This force is an exquisite expression of the flower of life itself.

The race organisers couldn't help the weather, but there was a lot throughout the day which showed that given the warning they had about the likelihood of poor weather, they could have performed a whole heap better than they did. This became abundantly clear from the start as only one entrance to the stadium was open though two were advertised in the programme - this meant all runners trying to get in and out through one gate. Pandemonium. At about this time - still with half an hour to go - organisers were trying to chivee everyone out of the stadium to start lining up at the start in the cold and wet.

That the lives of these old fellows we see on television, and whose names we now know, go back more than a century, touches us - and it may add to the power they project for us that they are not especially heroic and do not represent themselves that way. That they do not posture or make use of any of the rhetorical cliches, but are modest survivors of the ordinary circumstances and perils of living. And that on television, where glamorisation is almost a given, so that any claim they might once have had to youthful beauty is simply irrelevant. Very young people, I suspect, who find themselves living in a dangerous and chaotic world, and with their own lives fearfully before them, feel a special affection for these old fellows who have indestructibily battled through - and even a small sense of reassurance ...
To conclude: I'm sorry: but once again the New York Times is turning the reality of the issue upside-down.

That's it. There aren't really any short cuts. People always want short cuts. New acts often want to know how to get an agent.

That's how it works.

Although Emily knows her math facts fairly well, she could stand to improve her speed, so I was interested to see how Math Rider would stack up against other programs we've tried. It teaches mastery of all 4 math operations with numbers 1-12 and is designed for children ages 6-12. To play, the child begins a "quest." A short story scenario is given, then the child rides his or her horse, "Shadow," across deserts, mountains, and so on. Math problems appear at the bottom of the screen. As the problem is answered, the horse jumps over an obstacle. If the problem is missed, the horse stops while the game gives the correct answer. The problems and speed are adjusted to the child's abilities, with problems the child has trouble with generated more frequently.

She wasn't interested. Said it was too young for her. That might be because she just finishing up her 4th grade brothers book, Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief.

There was that time I watched my father in a televised drama where he was portraying yet another down and out character. There was a part where he was cold and shivering and sad, and I am told I came out from under the dining table that was my favourite hiding spot and offered my blankie to the television set saying "Here daddy, you can have my blankie, you don't have to be cold!" The adults thought that was the sweetest, funniest thing ever, but to my four year old mind, my father was suffering and I wanted to help. I knew he was pretending, but could I be really, really sure he wasn't actually cold?

SkyWest's total operating revenues increased $55.2 million, or 6.4%, during the quarter ended March 31, 2012, over the same period in 2011. The increase in operating revenues was the result of higher pass-through costs (primarily fuel and engine overhaul costs) under SkyWest's agreements with its major partners and an increase in block hour production. The increase in operating revenues was offset by a planned reduction in prorate flying block hours of 13.4% resulting in reduced revenues of approximately $6.0 million. In spite of the reducing operating revenues from prorate flying, SkyWest's revenue per available seat mile for this flying increased 14.6% from improved pricing. After excluding the increased pass-through costs of approximately $31.1 million, for fuel and engine overhauls, and the reduction in prorate flying revenue of $6.0, total operating revenues increased approximately $30.1 million due to the additional block hour production of 3.1% and improved utilization. Total block hours for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 were 556,421 compared to 539,910 for the same period last year.

SkyWest's total operating revenues increased $55.2 million, or 6.4%, during the quarter ended March 31, 2012, over the same period in 2011. The increase in operating revenues was the result of higher pass-through costs (primarily fuel and engine overhaul costs) under SkyWest's agreements with its major partners and an increase in block hour production. The increase in operating revenues was offset by a planned reduction in prorate flying block hours of 13.4% resulting in reduced revenues of approximately $6.0 million. In spite of the reducing operating revenues from prorate flying, SkyWest's revenue per available seat mile for this flying increased 14.6% from improved pricing.

When I was in Phnom Penh recently, I discovered in the guidebook that there was a cafe called the "Lazy Gecko Cafe". I looked it up on the map and saw that it was quite far from where I was staying and also from most of the areas I would be visiting. However, the pull to seek out this lazy gecko was strong and on my final day, I decided to hunt it down and sink a coffee or two.

Now, I don't want to sound like I'm crapping on the whole movie, because I actually did enjoy it. I think they did some perfect casting with Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades. They are two of my favorite actors, and I can't think of any two people more perfect for those two roles. I also have a huge crush on the ruggedly handsome Sam Worthington, and Mads Mikkelson is pretty much great in everything he does, and this is no exception. My favorite part of the movie was the whole Medusa scene. From Io explaining the Medusa backstory to Perseus cutting off her head, it is amazing! Its nuts because they all survive these giant ass scorpions, and the three witches (also a cool scene.."a sacrifice!"), but they all drop like flies when it comes to Medusa. She doesn't even have to do anything. She looks at you...you die. End of story.
3. (C) After thanking PM Meles for the meeting and noting the positive U.S.-Ethiopian relationship, Sen. Feingold asked the PM about Ethiopian plans for dealing with Somalia. Meles replied that the situation in Somalia had deteriorated significantly in the last six months. Like the Taliban in Afghanistan, the CIC had filled a political vacuum in Somalia, providing security and stability in areas that they controlled. Meles said the CIC was also riding a wave of resurgent Jihadism in the region which had been encouraged by developments in Iraq and Afghanistan. He noted that the CIC had been implementing the same brand of radical Islam espoused by other extremists, as was evidenced by their censoring of television programming and cinemas, as well as their ban on khat. Meles acknowledged that Somalis had traditionally resisted such extreme interpretations of Islam, but also remarked that Somalis "liked to back a winning horse" and Jihadists had accumulated a string of victories that was winning converts to their cause. This gathering military momentum had allowed a relatively small group of extremists to dominate the large and diverse organizations who formed the CIC. Meles said CIC leaders Sheik Aweys, Aidan Ayro and Hassan al-Turki had direct connections to Al Qaeda that were known to intelligence services, including in the U.S. He agreed with Sen. Feingold's suggestion that the CIC could be considered a "franchise of Al Qaeda."

During the evenings the crickets and cicadas sing. Combined with roosters, hens, ducks, wild birds, yowling skinny cats and the nightly chorus sent up by the campus's dog population this can all add up to quite the racket at bed time.

I hope he's found his way to safety, it's a jungle out there.

Tennessee invoked the rule for the 1975 season, during the time when the maximum number of scheduled games was eleven. That season, the Vols traveled to Honolulu for their 12th scheduled game, winning 28-6. There were four non-conference games at home on the schedule that season - Maryland, North Texas State, Colorado State, and Utah - with a fifth on the road (UCLA). I don't know which of those four home NC games was the extra one added due to the Hawaii game. I hope it wasn't North Texas State - the worst Volunteer loss I personally ever witnessed.

"Skippy" is in the Army, so I had to drop him off on base. When I pulled up to the curb, we kinda just sat there and looked at each other. It was awkward because Julius was in the backseat hahaha.

Biologists generally agree, however that one feature above all others defines the orchid and differentiates it from virtually all other flowering plants - the fusion of the male portion of the flower (stamens) and the female portion (pistils). Orchid flowers are pollinated by a great variety of flying animals, and their diversity in floral structure has resulted from adaptations to various pollinators. About half the orchid species are pollinated by bees; moths, butterflies, flies, birds, and other agents pollinate the rest. Many orchid flowers are adapted for pollination by a single species of insect.

I don't know.maybe nobody else feels like this about indie publishing. But this is sort of where I think I am with it. It's wonderful on so many levels - but its big flaw, I think, is that it's just too easy. Too easy to implement.too easy to mess up.too easy to get discouraged (because your frame of reference when you're solo is really quite small). Too easy, essentially, to jump in when you're green and flounder around.because you're green.

I learned about Oh My Melodies from Espousal Records' Kyoungmo Kim as he updated me on the current whereabouts of the members of emo pop band I Love JH. I was instantly charmed by what I heard and returned to listen every now and then. Recently this has happened more frequently, and for reasons that will become obvious tomorrow I found the perfect opportunity to find out more about Oh My Melodies straight from the source:
Under both systems, sacrifice is invoked as a magic, omnipotent solution in any crisis-and "the public good" is the altar on which victims are immolated. But there are stylistic differences of emphasis. The socialist-communist axis keeps promising to achieve abundance, material comfort and security for its victims, in some indeterminate future. The fascist-Nazi axis scorns material comfort and security, and keeps extolling some undefined sort of spiritual duty, service and conquest. The socialist-communist axis offers its victims an alleged social ideal. The fascist-Nazi axis offers nothing but loose talk about some unspecified form of racial or national "greatness." The socialist-communist axis proclaims some grandiose economic plan, which keeps receding year by year. The fascist-Nazi axis merely extols leadership-leadership without purpose, program or direction-and power for power's sake.

The yellow shoes I made were turned, literally. Made inside out, then flipped. The outer sole is stitched directly to the uppers. This style is around and fashionable for all of our time period. It is the least durable, since it cannot be re-soled and has to have a thinner sole to be able to be turned. However, this makes it the daintiest of shoe styles.

I'm Unschooled. Yes, I Can Write. celebrated it's third birthday yesterday (though there wasn't much celebrating since I didn't realize until today that yesterday was the third anniversary of this blog!). When I started writing it, I had a vague idea that I wanted to prove to both myself, and whatever rare reader stumbled across my blog, that unschoolers really do learn things all the time. That unschooling really "works." But as I grew more confident in unschooling, and as my writing/blogging skills improved, I started to focus less on my-unschooling-life-as-it-happens, and more on the philosophy of unschooling, using my life to illustrate the points I was trying to make. I enjoyed (and still enjoy) writing that type of post. Apparently, so do other people! I started, as most blogs do, with virtually no readers (family doesn't count). And now, three years later, just through Blogger's follower tracker (which only counts people who have a Blogger account and choose to follow this blog through their account) I have nearly 430 followers. This blog's Facebook page has over 1,800 fans. This blog has gotten big! And through blogging, I'm speaking at a conference again this fall (possibly two, as I've been invited to a vague conference that may or may not be happening in Montreal, as well), am recognized by name at most education things I go to, and have been asked (though whether I say yes or not depends on a lot of things) for film, radio, article, and blog post interviews.

Our personal psychology is how our karmic patterns show up in this lifetime.

On days that I need to complete a lot I will set my timer for 15 minutes and work on one task for the full 15 minutes. I will stop that task when the timer goes off and move on to another task. This usually happens on good days, where the pain is tolerable. I will work on one task, for example, clearing clutter in one room, then I move to 15 minutes doing computer work, then 15 minutes cleaning a focus zone, then 15 minutes reading. I try to alternate from something physical to something sedentary, and including a 15 minute "break" every third 15 minute session. This is what I call my 15 minute day, and I find that I am most productive these days.

Jim also spends a lot of time reminding his readers of his stature, both financial and otherwise, in China. He writes about his fancy car, his lush apartment, his ability to lavish financial gifts on those around him. Two examples will serve to illustrate, but such examples could be multiplied many, many times. In chapter 5 ("Walkabout") Jim recounts how he left his protective hotel to take a walk in the "other China". He abandoned his "car and driver" to walk around Chongqing's poorer neighborhoods. He gets lost, asks some kids where the nearest McDonalds was, and was escorted by fifteen street children there. Jim then describes his arrival at the eatery:

I've found someone that I think I really like, and I'm a little surprised because it is not someone that would ever catch my eye...I mean, the kind of person that you go by in the grocery store and don't even notice. But once you make yourself look, well, his heart is like a kaleidoscope of radiant gems and syrups. My own juices are flowing with the bright heat of summer, and love is floating with the fuzzy cotton tree seeds in the wind.

You know the old phrase, "Stop and smell the roses"? I think stopping to smell the lilacs is even more important since their luscious blooms only happen for a short time each year. I have to remember to jam my nose into their blooms (checking for bees first, of course) and drink up all their sweet fragrance often before it's gone.

According to this reliable hadith, the cursing of a Muslim constitutes moral depravity. When any Muslim dares to curse another Muslim, this amounts to moral depravity - all the more so when it is done by a scholar, who is considered by some to be a source of authority in Islamic law. He dares to curse, to slander, to make unfounded accusations, and to sanction the killing, execution, and stoning of people. He uses black incitement against a Muslim. This is the height of moral depravity.
8. The Addams Family (Main Title) - Vic Mizzy
My theme for this month is Go Outside. Weird, possibly, but relevant, particularly since in just 21 days I will be swimming 5km for Marie Curie Cancer Care. In the last month I have done precisely no training whatever, so I'm very likely to not make my target of under an hour and a half, but I will complete the 5km, come hell or high water. I plan to go to the gym every day for the next 21 days, starting tomorrow. It's a good theme, I think. I plan to spend regular time outside or at the gym, even if it's only half an hour. Money is tight again now, but going for a walk is free and it's a good way to spend time with my kids, my man or just myself. I tend to do my best thinking in the five minutes it takes me to shower - I've come up with all sorts of speech ideas and blog posts, you wouldn't believe it. I hope that a couple of hours in the gym every day will give me lots of great thinking time and lots of fabulous ideas will flow.

This year tested that faith. There is no way around it: This was a lousy year in sports. Scandal. Disgrace. Crime. The horror in and around sports rose to previously unimagined depths -- the empire struck back, the dark side reigned. Penn State dominated the news, but there were charges elsewhere, in too many places, in Miami and Ohio State and Syracuse and, well, who could keep up? Players went on strike. Owners locked out. Fan favorites left town. Legends went on trial. Concussions. Perjury. PEDs.

Then as the conversation wasn't really going to settle anywhere and it was already getting late, I just moved them on to starting to prep the weeks passage. Esther said, we need to talk. So they went into doing personal time with the text and we talked in someone's room. She was visibly distraught and shared her heart that she was upset in the unbelief that had been coming out in our discussion of what to do about large group. At first I was a little taken aback but as she shared her heart and I reflected back on the conversation, I could see that she was right. We had but Jesus back into a box declaring for him what he could/couldnt do in and through our new people hours after having taken him our of the box at fall con. I felt convicted of my own desire to appease people and unbelief of how Jesus could work at UCI. So we came back together with our leaders and Esther shared her heart, her Holy discontent at what had just transpired and it led to a time of repentance from all of our leaders. That would have been cool enough but in the midst of that time, Jesus ministered to the leader I had prayed with at Fall Con by calling out some of the lies he believed about himself being the weak link in the group as we all affirmed him. It was a beautiful moment of the Holy Spirit doing what was on its agenda, not ours. Please pray that we continue to be open to the interruption of the Spirit.

The "father of the H-bomb" was to his supporters a hero of the Cold War and to his detractors, the personification of the mad scientist. Between these extremes, an intriguing biographer emerges in Judging Edward Teller by Istvan Hargittai ($32.00, Prometheus Books). Teller was no shrinking flower. In addition to his prodigious intelligence he was, as one observer noted, "a monomaniac with many manias." He gained fame or infamy depending on one's point of view, when he denounced J. Robert Oppenheimer who led the team that created the A-bomb that ended the war with Japan, but was seen as a communist sympathizer. He is recalled for his fierce opposition to nuclear test bans during the Cold War and, toward the end of his life, as an advocate for the Strategic Defense Initiative. In retrospect, his excesses may well have contributed to the demise of the Soviet Union. He became the prototype for "Dr. Strangelove", but in truth Teller was a patriot who was totally devoted to the defense of the United States. Anyone with an interest in science and this history of the turbulent times of his life will find the book an excellent, absorbing biography.

But The Phantom, it seems, has been histroically overshadowed by the truly staggering popular reception that greeted the debut of Superman, and his equally colourful cohorts (such as Batman, Captain America, et al), from the 1940s onwards. Perhaps he simply wasn't "super" enough to stand out amongst the growing throngs of super-powered crime-fighters that crowded American comic-books for the duration of World War II. Even as costumed superheroes reasserted their status (after a decade-long hiatus) as the dominant American comic-book genre throughout the 1960s, The Phantom remained a secondary character, despite earning his first self-titled American comic-book series in 1962.

It is difficult to make a living from writing. I haven't cracked it yet, although I can see my income growing as I get more interest from foreign publishers and - crucially - manage to keep on producing books. If I compare it, though, to my career in journalism, I'm quite happy. Although I could earn considerably more with a staff job on a national newspaper (and they aren't any easier to come by than getting a book deal), my salary would be pretty much my limit. Whereas a book..well, anything could happen. It's possible for a book to earn for you again and again - a foreign sale here, a film deal there - while you're working on other stuff.

After all, this is no ordinary "comeback". This is a man that was among the best high school sprinters/hurdlers in the country (10.36/13.66) when he graduated in 2000 (= #4 in both events). He then went to the University of Tennessee where he won back to back NCAA sprint doubles as a frosh/soph and set a National Collegiate Record for 200 meters (19.86). He then went pro and following injury in his first pro season came back to win the Olympic 100 meter title in Athens (9.85) and then a sprint double in Helsinki (9.88/20.00) in very inclement weather. The follow up was an equaling of the then WR of 9.77 for 100 meters early the next season.

While the first narrative was about people who had a multitude of reasons to not be happy, the second one could've almost been a fairytale. Here we meet Antoine (Kevin Parent) a middle-aged DJ who is living an enviable life raising two gorgeous daughters with his equally pretty girlfriend (Evelyne Brochu). But life is not always a bed of roses because he still thinks of his ex-wife (Hélène Florent), his first love and original soul mate.
Alan was born in the Auvergnat town of Riom. His father Georges (Jord in Breton) Cochevelou was a civil servant in the French Ministry of Finance who achieved his dream of recreating a Celtic or Breton harp in the small town of Gourin, Brittany. In 1953, Alan began playing the instrument at the age of nine under the tutelage of his father and Denise Megevand, a concert harpist. Alan also learned Celtic mythology, art and history as well as the Breton language, traditional Breton dance and the Scottish bagpipe and the bombarde, a traditional Breton instrument, from the oboe family. Alan began playing concerts at eleven years and studying traditional Breton, English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh folk music, also learning the drum, Irish flute, and tin whistle. He competed in and won several Breton traditional music competitions in the Bleimor Pipe band. Alan spent his childhood in Paris, with its cosmopolitan influences from France, Algeria, Morocco and elsewhere. But he fell in love with Breton music and Celtic culture in general, and often went back in his teens to Brittany.

Before he set off for the show, he cooked us one of his speciality spaghetti Bologneses. After the show, my friend and I scoured late night shops for a doughnut, a cream bun and a sliceable cake to share with him. Eventually, we got a cake and doughnuts filled with custard. Close enough.

Tens of thousands of mainly Shiites took to the streets in Bahrain in February and March demanding political reform and better rights, with some calling for the downfall of the Al Khalifa monarchy. The uprising was brutally crushed by the regime and thousands were arrested and sacked from public and private sector jobs.

Geraldo made a statement that African American & Latino parents should know better than to let their children walk around with hoodies on because people will fear them. That's the hood will give people cause to arrest, frisk and/or harass them. He actually stated that the hoodie was as much to blame for Trayvon's murder as is Zimmerman. Yes, you read that right! This fool not only said, but then he tweeted it! Okay, well guess what? Zimmerman is not a police officer. Trayvon did not need to keep his hands and face in plain view of Zimmerman. Zimmerman sought him out and approached him. Trayvon didn't put his hoodie on until he felt someone following him. Before that he was a teenager walking down the street in a sweatshirt on a cold rainy night. Unless the boy was picking a lock or peering through someone's window, I'm not sure how he falls under a suspicious category. So its actually NOT the hoodie's fault.it's actually the ignorant vigilante's fault this boy is dead!

I was thinking, researching and analyzing a lot of information in past several months - particularly, how all those things happening in Thailand (political problems, social unrest) and in the world (economic crisis, "pandemic", rise of transnational corporate fascism), and perhaps fair to say in universe (I wouldn't got into much details about it here, would only say - all the metaphysical and spiritual sides of our existence and current events) - and how ALL that affects me personally. and mainly - what and how I should do about it.
Here's the Great Audrey. The pageant tiara or more commonly known Holly Golightly pictured below, is the tiara we associate with brides today.

Anyway, we soon found out that if you never spoke, the zombie outbreak didn't happen to most people. Much like the movie Pontypool, where the virus had attached to language itself. So a lot of us were walking from room to room, but really keeping conversation at a minimum, or not at all. Things were looking up near the end, but the whole dream was still kind of disturbing.

The story begins last May when, out of the blue, I received an email from Australia. Mick, the sender of said email, had stumbled across my blog when he was researching his family history. He introduced himself and explained that he had been through Kolky before and was very excited to learn that there was someone who he could communicate with now living in this village. His connection to Kolky, as well as other villages in my general area, came from some documents of his wife's side of the family. He also explained that he and Julie were coming to Eastern Europe again (among other places on their 6 week excursion) to retrace some of their steps, do some more searching and continue their investigation. Also he mentioned that one of their stops was Kolky!

It took all morning but we finally convinced Tali that she was two. She kept saying, "No!" but that her response to everything these days. ;) She didn't want to blow out the candles because she just wanted to dig into the cherry tomatoes. Those were the favorites and the first to disappear. Tali also ate the apples and sampled the cucumbers. Ana ate tomatoes, oranges, apples, cucumbers, and celery. She sampled the peppers. Amanda ate everything after arranging it all neatly on her plate. We didn't get to the pineapple so we'll try that at snack time.
The Kingdom of God starts small, a grain of wheat, a mustard seed, a leaven in the loaf. And it spreads, oh, yes, it grows. But it starts small, even hidden in the secret places, a knitting together of wonder, perhaps. A candle on a lamp stand, a woman searching for a coin, a man in a field with a treasure worth selling everything to possess.

The first step in making effective change in our behavior is awareness. So as a start, copy the list of offensive behaviors. After every sales call honestly evaluate yourself through the eyes of your prospect. For example, if you talked for more than 20% of the time, you are probably guilty of all of the first four offensive behaviors.

Remove chicken bones, skin, etc. from pot. Remove and discard bay leaves and anything else. You should have approximately 3 quarts of stock.

Besides, isn't state-ism itself a religion for most Americans? Do they not honor the state above all else, above even the commandments of a conventional religion they may embrace? If their religion tells them "thou shalt not murder," but the state orders them to murder, then they murder. If the state tells them to rob, to destroy property, and to imprison innocent people, then, notwithstanding any religious strictures, they rob, destroy property, and imprison innocent people, as millions of victims of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and millions of victims of the so-called Drug War in this country will attest. Moreover, in every form of adversity, Americans look to the state for their personal salvation, just as before the twentieth century their ancestors looked to Divine Providence.
And the thing I am most proud of: I reupholstered my dining chairs. To be fair, the last one's seat pad is not yet reattached. After finishing three chairs Friday, I couldn't sleep because the muscles in my hands were quite literally on FIRE.

So we're back, it has been a life-changing experience, there have been a few tears but many, many, laughs. It is something that I have loved doing and it's bought Nabeela and I closer together.

People today wrongly pray for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit as they say the disciples did in the upper room. But I tell you the disciples were not praying for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. They knew what was expected of them and I am sure they were seeking wisdom as to how to go about replacing Judas and preparing themselves for the great ministry that had been given to them.
Charles describes Google as the elephant in this particular room (in the proper sense of the very big thing that no-one mentions), drawing the conclusion that Google's appointment last summer of Autonomy's Jack Halprin is a sign that Google wants a slice of the eDiscovery market.
The only catch? On Passover, we're not allowed to eat bread. This has to do with the part of the Passover story where the Jews wander the desert, and are unable to make leavened bread. By not eating bread for seven days, we pay tribute to what our ancestors had to suffer during their exodus.

Nursing-sadly no. Mama dried up and Jonah wasn't getting nearly enough so we weaned. It was sad but then it was freeing for me. I was either pregnant or nursing for over three years! That's a long time so I was kinda happy to have my body back although I would have nursed longer, as long as he wanted if it had been possible.

First of all, for those who don't know I have 3 adopted siblings. They are all from the Philippines. Actually there are six kids in my family and our order goes a bit like this - biological, adopted, biological, adopted, biological, adopted. :) My parents were also foster parents for about 8 years, so we had infants in and out of our house - most in which (I think) were adopted. So as you can tell adoption has been a pretty big part of my life. I always knew I wanted to adopt. It just seemed like something I was suppose to do when having a family. My husband's family is a bit different from mine - he's the only one! Although we came from different types of families, we both knew we wanted to have a family eventually.
Even more importantly I think I'm having a rebirth of my spirit. For the longest time I've basically just existed. I've done the bare minimum around the house. It's been a struggle to get that done too. But the last few weeks I've been WANTING to spread my wings and take the time to make the homemade breads and the homemade snacks. I've been wanting to do that stuff. It's almost like I'm being reborn. I don't know what has brought this about. I'm afraid to blink...afraid that it will go away if I do. I still have all the stress and depression in my life....but I'm really trying to not let it affect ME. And maybe that's the whole difference.
A pipe dream, I know, as so many see the wheels as an extension of their existence. Could one really expect all the insecure men fearful about the size of their penises to not hop into these big trucks so they can feel big in the world?

The tan color deepened to brown and spread around me. To my astonishment, the area of color developed, like a photo, into a vision of a man with chocolate-brown skin. He superimposed himself over the left side of my face and upper chest and my left arm, and I perceived him as if from the inside and the outside at the same time. I could actually see him, with technicolor clarity, something that had never, ever happened to me before. He looked to be in his mid-thirties, with very round cheeks and prominent eyes, a little like Louis Armstrong. I heard the name "Bertram."

As stated in his book "The Leadership Engine", Tichy Noel reinforces that learning is a key requirement for developing leadership. We enhance our unique qualities through learning and education. Studying abroad was probably one of the richest experiences of my life. It was a privilege to study for my MBA at Duke, The Fuqua School of Business. It was a unique moment of my life. The globally focused education allowed me to make a deep personal assessment while providing me with an actionable set of global leadership tools. (Not to mention that I met my wife during my MBA, this is awesome).

You know, even though the use of the media in this book was slightly exaggerated, it is true, people of our age have no other source of information. All we know about the wars, the natural disasters, and etc. we know from media. The media does have the power to motivate, demotivate, and form the opinion of the people.
Our personal psychology is how our karmic patterns show up in this lifetime. A general Buddhist or Hindu perspective on karma suggests that the individual soul moves through consciousness lifetime after lifetime, incarnating again and again in the school of life in order to complete various tasks and lessons, and to release contractions of consciousness.

Let me pause for a moment. I'm sure that many of you feel that an evening out can be a very much needed thing. I am even sure that it can be well deserved too. But what I haven't told you yet is that that was the first time in four days I had seen Jack.
When the captain of your ship tells you to do something in a somewhat frenzied or stern voice, it's almost always for your own good and everyone else's, so you should just shut your mouth and do it. And not get defensive about it.
On days that I need to complete a lot I will set my timer for 15 minutes and work on one task for the full 15 minutes. I will stop that task when the timer goes off and move on to another task. This usually happens on good days, where the pain is tolerable. I will work on one task, for example, clearing clutter in one room, then I move to 15 minutes doing computer work, then 15 minutes cleaning a focus zone, then 15 minutes reading. I try to alternate from something physical to something sedentary, and including a 15 minute "break" every third 15 minute session. This is what I call my 15 minute day, and I find that I am most productive these days.

This film is crazy but there is streak of dark humour running through it all. Rupert Everett narrates Francesco's thoughts throughout the film, including his meditations on the meaning of life death and love.

This has led to legal repercussions on more than one occasion.

We wear the babies on our bodies in Bjorns, Moby's, or slings, as we did with A. She is a tiny three-year-old, so a month ago, I asked her if she wanted to ride in the Ergo carrier on my back, since she was feeling jealous that O-Bear was in the Bjorn, next to me. She climbed in and I wore her on my back while I made cookies. She laid her sweet blonde head onto my back and said, "Ahhh. Isn't it nice to be stuck together like glue again, Mommy?" MELT.

The story line is straightforward and simple and the newlyweds in real life Riteish Deshmukh and Genelia D'Souza do form an endearing pair on screen as well. Genelia scores simply by underplaying her ebullience. Well suited for the role of the gutsy, bindaas female lead requirement, she has successfully overcome the temptation to display her teeth in every scene of the movie. It may still require her more time and effort to match the histrionics of what Kareena Kapoor managed to achieve in the portrayal of a similar character in JAB WE MET, but if she works on her dialogue delivery and attempting more changes to her facial expressions depending on the requirement of the scene, she will certainly leave a mark.

When your boyfriend or potential boyfriend is an MD, all the more will a girl's Nancy Drew side act up. An MD is exposed to guests of all colors, shapes and sizes. It's not unlikely that an MD will be tempted to cheat on his partner. Hence, researching in this case could be a girlfriend's defense mechanism.

Step 2 - Drop and Bake: Drop batter by tablespoon onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in a well pre-heated 350º F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Do not over-bake. Cookies should be a bit gooey in the center. While warm, they will be very soft on the outside, as well. Allow them to cool on the pan a few minutes and then transfer carefully to a rack to finish cooling. (They will always be somewhat soft because these are gooey fudge brownie cookies, not hard or crunchy cookies.)

I started with Indus, an IPA. It looked to be pouring a bit flat and it took a bit of coaxing to get a loose-bubbled head to form on the top. It didn't last long. However the beer really benefits from the low carbonation as it creates a wonderful cask-like effect, with just enough sparkle to push the flavours out. Naturally enough, it's hops out front: good honest English varieties by the taste of them, with lots of floral orange blossom laid on quite intensely, creating almost a resinous burn while staying clean and crisp, avoding all harshness. At 4.6% ABV it's around a percentage point weaker than the likes of White Shield and Bengal Lancer, but I'd regard it as being very much in the same league. The balance of marmalade and toffee you get in the others isn't present here, but the hop punchiness makes up for it for me. Tangy, sinkable and with a lasting bitterness, I really enjoyed it.
The next morning we made the short trip from Bela Vista, the small village on the Paraguayan border where we had stayed the previous night, to Fazenda Marilandia. This ranch is owned by Renata Stephen's (our tour guide) aunt, Maria Loureiro Pinheiro, and is managed by her son, (Renata's first cousin) Sergio Loureiro Pinheiro. The head cowboy, Roberto, was also available to show us around. He has been employed by Fazenda Marilandia for 35 years.
*Our yard is going to pot from lack of rain. Being restricted to sprinkler watering once a week is not enough, not with these relentless high temperatures we are experiencing. I go outside at twilight, when it is still 95 degrees, to water by hand a couple times a week, but it gets dark too fast.Everyone is getting as sick of the weather as they are of complaining about it.
2. Bring an Abundance of Water and Food on Hikes: The rule of thumb when hiking is: when half of your water supply is gone, start heading back. Last summer I hiked Upper Yosemite Falls, one of the oldest trails in Yosemite, and leads to the highest waterfall in North America at 2,425 ft. It took me 3 hours to hike up and I tried to conserve my water as much as possible but unfortunately I was not able to. Fortunately, when I finally got to the top there was a benevolent man who was filtering water, from the waterfall, to give to weary hikers. Make sure to bring snacks that are high in protein and carbohydrates such as granola bars and nuts because when the hike says strenuous, it means it!

SB 10.88.25-26: The great demigods could only remain silent, not knowing how to counteract the benediction.

That realm is the destination of renunciants who have attained peace and given up all violence against other creatures. Going there, one never returns.
In five stories, Christie allows the murderer to escape justice (and in the case of the last three, implicitly almost approves of their crimes); these are The Witness for the Prosecution, The Man in the Brown Suit, Murder on the Orient Express, Curtain and The Unexpected Guest. (When Christie adapted Witness into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed.) There are also numerous instances where the killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but instead dies (death usually being presented as a more 'sympathetic' outcome), for example Peril at End House, Death on the Nile, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Crooked House, Appointment with Death, The Hollow, and Secret Adversary. In some cases this is with the collusion of the detective involved. Five Little Pigs, and arguably Ordeal by Innocence, end with the question of whether formal justice will be done unresolved.
Even though it was quite disappointing for we the children, the parents especially the mothers were happy because it spared them the trouble of waking up at dawn to cook the Ampesi, Banku, Konkonte, Mpotopoto, Tuo Zaafi (Ghanaian dishes). Did I hear you say, you sent the Fried Rice and Chicken, Potato chips and Chicken and burgers? Hmm, my dear friend, this was what I dreamt of sending to Our Day. Nevertheless, Our Day was still fun. There were lots of toffees, chocolate, biscuits, cookies, drinks and delicious food from the school's canteen. The one who made my Our Day always memorable was one of my favourite teachers, Mr. Quartey. He was my class 5 teacher. He loved to pamper me and my squad (P.I.A - don't ask for the meaning). It wasn't that we were teachers' pets but... aha we had favour from our teachers.
forget about him and never see
Having such a huge burden gone has effected everything. I am back to making my meals in the morning. My dishes routine is working again. I have had the extra time to put most my cupboards etc in order again. It's like there's a light at the end of the tunnel...with projects I have been craving to do for so long. Stuff I enjoy. The last week or two I have started to feel that old me again. That girl that used to enjoy LOTS of things. Feels so good.
The weather's been beautiful this past week: blue skies, sunshine, rising temperatures. It's even been warm enough to eat lunch outside. It's really hard to believe that last year at this time, we still had a bit of snow. Of course, the cold can come back anytime, but for now, it's the most beautiful spring weather.
Now that a few days have passed, I look back on that Chrysalis weekend with such joy. I don't think about the logistics of it all, I think about how present God was throughout it. With God's help, that weekend was flawless. And as I sat on Sunday listening to these girls talk about how positively affected they were by this weekend.. I knew at that very instant that every bit of sweat and tears was worth it.
5. Place half of the rice mixture into the casserole dish, cover the bottom of the dish and up the sides, pressing it firmly into a bottom layer. Layer in the meat mixture and sprinkle mozzarella on top (saving some to sprinkle on top). Top with the remaining rice mixture and spread it until even. Top with the remaining tomato sauce, bread crumbs and cheese.

The story revolves around Vyme a mechanic at the star pit where ships are repaired. He tries to help out young people that want to work in the repair shops. One is Ratit. It seems Vyme misses his own group family and his kids. He has a drinking problem and that alienated him from everyone.

And then there's the moment when it all stops. Its like pressing the button that has a warning sign hung over it. Or like entering the garden that says "beware of the dog". Sometimes you just gotta beat the odds and see how you turn up around the end. You realize that many people including society, people, extended family, friends expect you to live a certain way. A way that they would approve of. A way that pleases them. It wouldn't bring them real happiness but it would leave them guiltless yet content. So when you stop walking on the sidelines and take a detour to the destination you think you belong to or transform yourself to the person you want to be. The one that really makes YOUR heart happy, you don't see a lot of takers. You don't even find many standing by your side at the end of the journey. You din't fit the bill. You can't be a part of the group coz you're now an extrovert not an introvert. You can't get trodden to the ground. You won't take everyone's bullshit and hide it in your heart but you will give an equally tough fight. Maybe tougher. You won't run to that emo corner and cry it off and emerge like you rose from the dead- So now, this confident, outgoing self is not acceptable.
Although I wasn't there(regretfully)to cheer on my very best running friends, I am in awe of their strength, determination and bravery. They headed into the worst of conditions and hung in their with their heads held high and they gave it their very, very best.

The Kingdom of God starts small, a grain of wheat, a mustard seed, a leaven in the loaf. And it spreads, oh, yes, it grows. But it starts small, even hidden in the secret places, a knitting together of wonder, perhaps. A candle on a lamp stand, a woman searching for a coin, a man in a field with a treasure worth selling everything to possess.

Make Or Break: The film is a bit windy overall. But at times, moves so fast it's a bit of a struggle to stay on top of the story line. We go from a porno movie shoot (titles of films produced by the duo include Jungle Lust and Lunar Lust) to upstate New York to a werewolf in a business suit riding a bicycle around town (puts the werewolf character in Turkey Shoot to shame), and then back into a back-stabbing hunt for the sword Excalibur with some eastern Europeans, a pair of bungling local cops and Dracula. I know...I know...
The new characters were incredibly underdeveloped; Angelica, Blackbeard, the Minister, and the mermaid all felt forced upon the audience as if we were suppose to enjoy them, but realistically they were just annoying. Angelica is mad at Jack for taking her virginity (wasn't pirates suppose to be geared for Children?) Blackbeard hides in his cabin for most of the film (wasn't he the scariest pirates of all time?) the Minister falls in love with the mermaid (who in this film can shoot spiderwebs from their wrists like Spider-Man) just because he sees her naked (again, Disney, Pirates, Children?) and the Mermaid needs to shed one tear (there were enough tears of pain from the audience to solve that problem).
Even though it was quite disappointing for we the children, the parents especially the mothers were happy because it spared them the trouble of waking up at dawn to cook the Ampesi, Banku, Konkonte, Mpotopoto, Tuo Zaafi (Ghanaian dishes). Did I hear you say, you sent the Fried Rice and Chicken, Potato chips and Chicken and burgers? Hmm, my dear friend, this was what I dreamt of sending to Our Day. Nevertheless, Our Day was still fun. There were lots of toffees, chocolate, biscuits, cookies, drinks and delicious food from the school's canteen. The one who made my Our Day always memorable was one of my favourite teachers, Mr. Quartey. He was my class 5 teacher. He loved to pamper me and my squad (P.I.A - don't ask for the meaning). It wasn't that we were teachers' pets but... aha we had favour from our teachers.

But Tom Hiddleston. Man, is Tom Hiddleston good. He plays Loki the same way he played the character in Thor, not as a cartoon villain but as an at times sympathetic man torn between the way he regards his brother with both familial love and burning jealousy. There are scenes between Thor and Loki where you can almost see Loki willing to put an end to all of this, but too far in to stop now. Loki is not absolutely a villain, and none of the heroes are absolutely heroes. They all have doubts and moments of cynicism. It's what elevates the movie beyond merely a collection of character moments and an action-packed third act: the continuing thread about what the nature of heroism really is, where it comes from, and how it can be used to affect the world. It was there in Captain America: The First Avenger when Steve Rogers told Dr. Erskine "I don't want to kill anybody. I don't like bullies. I don't care where they're from." It was there when Thor learned how to wield his power for others and Tony Stark conquered his daddy issues.
At around dusk, Emi asked if I wanted to go for a walk in the woods, and of course I said yes. We picked up a friend of hers on the way. It rained this afternoon, and everything had that fresh, sweet smell that you always get after rain in the spring time. The Peepers were deafening as we picked our way through the slick mud, over wet rocks, and through damp grasses, fending off mosquitoes as we went. Emi tried to catch a frog (it was brown, though we're not sure what type it was.) as we wound our way through the flooded areas, looking for peepers and other frogs. We saw the colour of the sky through the trees as the sun set.

At first, Rebecca Smith was relieved when she got a phone call from an FBI agent. It was October, just a few months after Smith had spent $30,000 on a real estate investment. The woman who sold her the deal, Karen Hanover, hadn't come through on any of her promises, and Smith was worried.
Yes, I would have made it work!! Even if my house would have been filled with these things until it burst or I sold them!

It's also not clear how much we should cheer the 64.6 percent increase in the number of Black-owned non-employer firms. Average revenues at these firms dropped 10.7 percent in real terms between 2002 and 2007. Perhaps more importantly, in 2007 the average revenue at a Black-owned non-employer firm was only $18,500 (in 2002 dollars).
Another reason we traveled to Seattle was to visit our previous exchange student, Chris. Chris is now a junior at the University of Washington majoring in computer science. It was so wonderful to visit with her and take a tour of her beautiful campus.
Having a good reputation is something you want in the music business. It sounds like obvious good advice for artists to tell them to be able to play well with others, but this also needs to include others you might not like or want to play with. In todays music business, you may come across and have to work with people you don't like, they might be doing things you cant stand, but bashing them excessively online or around others is not going to help you get what you want in the end.
That view, of connections to one another, could have begun in the ancient Jewish belief of blessings and cursings. The translators of Christ's words may have been a bit leery of the idea of cursing someone. "Blessed are the meek" was fine. But cursing the un-meek? Did they change the words so that we read now the easier-to-digest "woe unto him"? As in, perhaps, "woe unto him who hurts the least of these, the children." . Sounds safe enough until you realize this may be an example of the Jewish belief in cursing someone, in proclaiming your hope in his receiving his just desserts for a particular behavior. Pedophilia, anyone?

Singer Dionne Warwick showed that the way to San Jose isn't the only thing she's not familiar with, as she pawed in bewilderment at the cash register.

But the struggle that I have
The time has come - finally - for somebody with a sensible agenda to intervene in the insane race now taking place across the Channel between the markets and Berlin. Not just because, if they don't, scorched earth will be all that's left; but also because both sides are scared - and so the time is right.

While Nicholas tries to figure away to rescue Sacha's head from a life of ghoulish servitude, the Baron and Otto are down in the lab trying get their walking corpses to mate with one another. Repeatedly instructing his female zombie to kiss his male zombie, the Baron grows increasingly frustrated by the male zombie's lack of arousal after each command to "kiss him" fails to bare any erectile fruit. Unaware that Sacha's brain is not wired for sex, the Baron starts to loose it. Blaming everything from the blood they used to outside agitators, the Baron is determined to get his zombies to procreate, as it's his dream to create a race of superior beings with Serbian noses.

WEALTHY FAMILIES: The first is wealthy families where the older generation has retired or is nearing retirement. Typically, their income is secure and they're concerned primarily with wealth protection and transfer. Agents may find that these wealthy families can take underutilized or under-performing assets and convert them to a permanent life insurance policy, often with the added advantage of a LTC rider. This strategy helps secure their wealth and makes it possible to pass on their assets to heirs in a tax-advantaged way, as well as assuring their long-term security if they need care.
Admiral Ororod did not garner the complete respect of those under him; he had connections, came from a well-to-do family with important political ties, more a bureaucrat with aspirations for a political career than a military career, he ran his detachment more like a business than the military unit it was. He may have been far from the most inspirational of fleet officers, but his politically minded motivations also helped to ensure that the Orion was one of the top training vessels in all the fleet.

But ending her relationship with the bikini company did not make Farrow any less dangerous. Her near-nakedness remained on display in places like Penthouse Magazine, FHM Magazine, and numerous other places who trade on the twisted ways of immodest women and play with the safety of the world on a regular basis. And as the years went by, Farrow started adding more tattoos to her body, making her not only an immodest women, but an immodest women who violated divine commandments by marking her body! There can be little question that she can be held responsible for the 2008 Sichuan earthquake that killed over 68,000 people in China.
To conclude: I'm sorry: but once again the New York Times is turning the reality of the issue upside-down.

Color mixing went very fast for this too. I'm getting more confident with it. My blues are greyed with orange, and my reds with green. I'm finding that my blues go toward orange too much, and I think I'm going to start using black and white to grey my colors a bit more along with compliments. It really depends on the color though. Because every color has a cast to it, and isn't a perfect blue or orange, when you mix them to get grey you can get unpredictable results, and I like that, but I want to get more control over it in a more predictable way, so straight up grey should help.
I hope all the kids had as much fun as I did. Plenty of smiles and no tears would suggest so.
First of all, for those who don't know I have 3 adopted siblings. They are all from the Philippines. Actually there are six kids in my family and our order goes a bit like this - biological, adopted, biological, adopted, biological, adopted. :) My parents were also foster parents for about 8 years, so we had infants in and out of our house - most in which (I think) were adopted. So as you can tell adoption has been a pretty big part of my life. I always knew I wanted to adopt. It just seemed like something I was suppose to do when having a family. My husband's family is a bit different from mine - he's the only one! Although we came from different types of families, we both knew we wanted to have a family eventually.

Maybe Facebook should hire Thomas Friedman to do its ads. His ad for Coursera (h/t Indyanna's comment at Historiann's) column on online education pretty much explains why the 100,000-person online class and the flipped classroom, with local professors as glorified tutors, is the way to go. The comments are good, and they ask the same questions we've all been asking and come to some similar conclusions.
Ben is determined to take Bailey out for a nice dinner but you know this is going to be hard to do. This becomes clear when a van crashes through the ER and the driver is hurt. Even though this is the day of love, people still died in this episode and it was very sad. Meredith, who I absolutely adored this episode, helps a woman whose body is attacking itself because she has a tumor. Meredith calls in Bailey, who finds a growth on the womans lungs but this turns out to be the wrong tumor.

I'm sure that many times, if not most of the time, she was at least partially asleep for many of the thrashing episodes, but just not resting. She has had several nights of strange waking that's not really waking. She sometimes sits up, even says something, then collapses again with a snore. A couple times I put her on the changing table to do some saline drops in the nose, she would count the drops like she always does ("1, 2, 3, 4 drops" "other side"), but then she would instantly be quiet, and her breathing maintained the deep rhythm, even though it was labored. Then in 5 seconds, startling again. So weird.
My memoir on adopting my daughter from China was perhaps the hardest thing I ever wrote mainly because at the same time that I was trying to understand what was going on, what this sudden unexpected journey in the middle of my life actually meant, to capture in words what it actually felt like- I was trying to get others to understand, to feel all of this at the same time.
I was satisfied when one student said, "Man, we do everything- car wash, christmas chicken dinner, now football in the rain!" And I expected some repirmand from the principal, as we sat musty and excited during the 2nd quarter awards ceremony for the last hour of the day.

During the evenings the crickets and cicadas sing. Combined with roosters, hens, ducks, wild birds, yowling skinny cats and the nightly chorus sent up by the campus's dog population this can all add up to quite the racket at bed time. Speaking of ducks, on my walk home from the office yesterday a tiny yellow duckling waddled across the open-air hallway I was threading my way through, looking lost yet determined. I hope he's found his way to safety, it's a jungle out there.

Because that's how blogging works: I offer an endless supply of overshared details from my personal life and you voyeuristically consume them. Duh.

Sometimes the most exciting thing that happens involves wire, mesh and a recalcitrant dishwasher named Paco.

I used to sell property and casualty insurance down in Sarasota Florida. I remember after I got licensed I was supposed to find a target niche for my prospecting efforts and develop a marketing strategy to target businesses within that niche. I picked professional liability after some quick success in that line of business and put together a prospect list of companies who I wanted to approach about writing their insurance. There was one account that I set my eyes on and really wanted to land. It was a large multi location diagnostics facility with large property and casualty exposures that would not only result in a challenge to structure but would land me a huge commission if I could write the account.

The hose is long enough to locate the ink supply towards the left rear of the printer although not long enough to place it all the way behind the unit when routed across the front.
I went to the front desk and explained what happened and luckily they did give us a room (it would have been a long trip home!). We got the same type of room, same rate, but it was a handicapped accessible room. They probably hold those rooms back in case they are needed. I don't know yet if I got charged for our missed night. I had reserved the room with a card that I subsequently canceled (due to fraud). So I don't know if they would have been able to charge it or not.

"Skippy" is in the Army, so I had to drop him off on base. When I pulled up to the curb, we kinda just sat there and looked at each other. It was awkward because Julius was in the backseat hahaha. Anyway, I told him I had fun and I thanked him for being really nice. We also agreed that we needed to hang out again. Then he leaned over and gave me a hug. The end. Hahaha.

...I am going to define impatience as a strong sense of annoyance at the (usually) unintentional faults and failures of others. This impatience is often expressed verbally in a way that tends to humiliate the person (or persons) who is the object of the impatience.
I don't know.maybe nobody else feels like this about indie publishing. But this is sort of where I think I am with it. It's wonderful on so many levels - but its big flaw, I think, is that it's just too easy. Too easy to implement.too easy to mess up.too easy to get discouraged (because your frame of reference when you're solo is really quite small). Too easy, essentially, to jump in when you're green and flounder around.because you're green.
The aroma was filled with the recognizable smell of Smith and Cross: strong, funky and full of promise. Of course the molasses was there as well, though I am still not sure if I was smelling the actual molasses or the Smith and Cross. Also, the pineapple spear, which was an utter garnish failure, awkward protuberance that it was, added a bit of undefinable fruitiness to the nose. The first sip was very molasses-y, though the hogo of the rum carried through at the end. You would think that there would be some sweetness in this drink, but it was dry and earthy, with a vague powdery texture that made each sip seem almost chewy. After I increased the bitters, the spices became more detectable on the swallow. The flavors of the molasses were also enhanced by the increase in bitters--the drink seemed sweeter, in that pleasing molasses cookie way, and the flavors in general seemed more balanced. Overall, not bad but not great.
But then something else happened. That same baby that was gifted to her from heaven, the one she felt growing and moving in her womb, the same child that gave her pleasure every time he said 'mama', fell ill and died, in her lap.

Parts of the country are already drier than they were in the summer of 1976, when Britain experienced its worst drought for more than 100 years. Then water shortages led to standpipes being installed on residential streets, water supplies to businesses being rationed and schools having to close early.
We can tend to use spirituality like medicine or a hospital. We utilize it only when things aren't going right or when we're suffering financially, emotionally or relationally. Our pain and suffering, however, can be a path to transcending this selfish conception of spirituality into something more. It can make us ask the questions we normally wouldn't ask, and can lead us to bigger and broader questions, such "what's really the purpose of life?" and "how can we avoid suffering?"
When Abram finally requests the hand of his beautiful half sister Sarai, she asks only one thing- that he not take another wife. Her father finds this promise restrictive and only agrees if she makes a promise as well. She has to procure Abram a son and heir or else Abram's promise is null and void. Sarai is confident that she can keep up her end of the deal, so she agrees.
How does this event foreshadow the ministry of the Levites? (As we will see later, the Levites will be chosen of all the tribes of Israel to attend to the Tabernacle and the religious service.

While the first narrative was about people who had a multitude of reasons to not be happy, the second one could've almost been a fairytale. Here we meet Antoine (Kevin Parent) a middle-aged DJ who is living an enviable life raising two gorgeous daughters with his equally pretty girlfriend (Evelyne Brochu). But life is not always a bed of roses because he still thinks of his ex-wife (Hélène Florent), his first love and original soul mate.
On his pillow,
So I pondered and scratched out various possibilities, and casually read through various texts by and about Che or Abe, wondering what the most suggestive, poetic and concise way of connecting these two men across time and history could be, until one day I hit on something that I just knew was right. It was a quote, by Che, in reference to his trip to New York City in 1964 to address the United Nations' General Assembly. It seems that while he was in New York there were two attempts on his life, one by a man wielding a gun and one by a woman with a knife. When asked about these attacks by a journalist, he is said to have responded with a smile and a bemused wisecrack: "It is better to be killed by a woman with a knife than a man with a gun" said Che.

I registered for the enticer race but later chickened out and changed my entry to the 'Try-a-tri' (a very mini triathlon). Surprise, surprise, I actually enjoyed it - despite the lycra! I am now 'training' - if you can call it that - for Triathlon Pink in October 2011. This second one is slightly longer on each of the three legs (swim, bike, run) but is still mini. It's a breast cancer research fundraiser. You can donate here. I've decided to enter the Gold Coast event because I have a friend there I can stay with instead of having to find accommodation in Sydney.
2. Ngoni Makusha NCAA 100 Victory - Nothing like a great 100 to thrill the senses, and this was such a race. Channeling the spirits of Bob Hayes, Carl Lewis and Donovan Bailey, the slow starting Makusha blazed through the middle of the pack for the win in an NCAA record 9.89!
Well, we never made that myrtle. The problem wasn't the hogs busting us. It was the coyote. One old mangy dog was loitering around the herd. These pigs were big enough not to be bothered by a pesky song dog, but they certainly took notice of him after he caught wind of our activities and bounded away. The coup de grace, though, were the turkeys. A couple hens were holding sentry and naturally took off when they saw us, taking the finally-frightened hogs with them. Wild pigs don't have the best sense of sight, but they're wary enough to recognize something amiss. (And how strange is it to find a coyote, hogs, and turkeys hanging around each other outside of a Disney movie?)
As someone with Type 1 diabetes (the "real" diabetes, as I like to put it -- the kind you can't help getting), I sometimes wonder when I'll end up retiring, or how long I can escape death. So I wonder how much I should be saving for retirement. Will I get the typical 25-30 year long retirement? Or would I have to retire at 40 to pull that one off? If I work until I'm 65, I could have lots put away, only to die within 2 years if I'm lucky, on the other hand.

3. (C) After thanking PM Meles for the meeting and noting the positive U.S.-Ethiopian relationship, Sen. Feingold asked the PM about Ethiopian plans for dealing with Somalia. Meles replied that the situation in Somalia had deteriorated significantly in the last six months. Like the Taliban in Afghanistan, the CIC had filled a political vacuum in Somalia, providing security and stability in areas that they controlled. Meles said the CIC was also riding a wave of resurgent Jihadism in the region which had been encouraged by developments in Iraq and Afghanistan. He noted that the CIC had been implementing the same brand of radical Islam espoused by other extremists, as was evidenced by their censoring of television programming and cinemas, as well as their ban on khat. Meles acknowledged that Somalis had traditionally resisted such extreme interpretations of Islam, but also remarked that Somalis "liked to back a winning horse" and Jihadists had accumulated a string of victories that was winning converts to their cause. This gathering military momentum had allowed a relatively small group of extremists to dominate the large and diverse organizations who formed the CIC. Meles said CIC leaders Sheik Aweys, Aidan Ayro and Hassan al-Turki had direct connections to Al Qaeda that were known to intelligence services, including in the U.S. He agreed with Sen. Feingold's suggestion that the CIC could be considered a "franchise of Al Qaeda."
How can I do that? Did you happen to read my entry from yesterday? It goes along quite well with this thought. I must practice three things: justice, mercy and humility. All three are admirable traits in royalty. Isn't it what you envision when you think of a king, queen, prince or princess?
I am a preschool teacher for Toddlers.

Apparently we aren't the only ones who are connectivity-deprived on the Island - the line to get in and get online starts at about 9 on a Tuesday morning (the library is heartlessly closed on Sunday and Monday) with people flopped about the lawn looking listless and bereft. Then the doors open promptly at 10 and everybody pours into the adorable edifice on 58 North Summer Street.

He also sought to break from the class-conscious conventions of the 1930s and early 40s, when top hat and tails or tuxedos were the norm, by dancing in casual or everyday work clothes, so as to make his dancing more relevant to the cinema-going public. As his first wife, actress and dancer Betsy Blair explained: "A sailor suit or his white socks and loafers, or the T-shirts on his muscular torso, gave everyone the feeling that he was a regular guy, and perhaps they too could express love and joy by dancing in the street or stomping through puddles.he democratized the dance in movies."[14] In particular, he wanted to create a completely different image from that associated with Fred Astaire, not least because he believed his physique didn't suit such refined elegance: "I used to envy his cool aristocratic style, so intimate and contained. Fred wears top hat and tails to the manner born - I put them on and look like a truck driver."[2]

In the end, we got everything cleaned out and they apartments offered them a new apartment since the condition of the carpet, walls, and just everything in general was in such deplorable condition. I also told them that I wouldn't help them a second time. I don't think I could handle doing something like that more than once. I even refurnished their new place since all their furniture was ruined. T.V., couch, tables and chairs, beds, dressers, etc. I found all of it for them. Most of it was donated and some were my personal things.
I'm not prepared for the breaking down of my best friend, for the suffering and slow burn of flames licking at all she holds dear, her light and her laughter and her little family, her safe haven and her confidence. I'm not sure if I'm willing to drag her through this with me.

But fortunately the Meadowside offices are lovely and bright and there was a real surprise of a welcome when I finally reached the fourth floor ( toilets on the floor below.) "We've got something to show you," said Lucy with a grin and pulled me to a bookshelf display at the back of the room. And there is was! My novel, HIDDEN, in proper novel format! I was so excited.

The French have been particularly explicit in their imperial intentions regarding the Middle East and Africa:
We all know our mistakes and we're well aware of all the obvious ways we mess up and keep messing up. It's also one of the many reasons, we avoid God. Too many people think of God as the Judge of the Universe and feel unworthy to pray, step foot in a church, and hate the feeling of condemnation they feel when comparing themselves to what they ought to be doing.
I am so pasty looking that I had to make it black and white.
In five short months she has gone from snuggly newborn, to a delightful, giggly girl who is just about crawling. We have had a few presents opened under the Christmas Tree, and any toy that her brother leaves on the floor is up for grabs.
Now that a few days have passed, I look back on that Chrysalis weekend with such joy. I don't think about the logistics of it all, I think about how present God was throughout it. With God's help, that weekend was flawless. And as I sat on Sunday listening to these girls talk about how positively affected they were by this weekend.. I knew at that very instant that every bit of sweat and tears was worth it.

She is taking her ugly duckling status hard. She shrieks her Skeksis complaint call at everyone and everything. The serama have taken to hiding from her, and even the other pekins are giving her a wide berth. The newspaper on the coop floor feels the brunt of her temper, and she is spending a lot of time shrieking in the coop and flinging strips of mutilated broadsheet out of the pop hole door. The others wisely let her go to bed first, and only venture in to the coop when she's settled down to sleep. No one risks perching next to her. To add insult to injury, I have smothered her in mite powder as a precaution. So now she looks like a middle aged, balding goth with dandruff. It's a hard look to rock, frankly.

I realise that this could upset some residents of the 20th arrondisement but I've never been good at keeping foodie secrets. Saturday night I dined at Cyclo, a tiny Vietnamese restaurant on rue de Belleville, and soon discovered why it's one of the neighbourhood's best kept secrets. The place was full to the brim, with most of the patrons on a first-name basis with the owner - a charmingly flamboyant Vietnamese native who takes the utmost pride in each dish that comes out of his kitchen.
Funny I didn't need that book cause I was entertained the whole time I was in the air. You know you don't want to stare at the other passengers but you do. And you try and not think 'please don't sit by me" but you do. I scored with no babies next to me screaming (although there was an adorable screamer in front of me) . And the nice Scottish man in front of that baby.was so not impressed. The little one thought his head was a play toy. While he kept saying 'ma'am, ma'am' to get Moms attention.Mom and Dad kept slamming back beers and Vodka. We were on our way to Vegas!

And then there's the moment when it all stops. Its like pressing the button that has a warning sign hung over it. Or like entering the garden that says "beware of the dog". Sometimes you just gotta beat the odds and see how you turn up around the end. You realize that many people including society, people, extended family, friends expect you to live a certain way. A way that they would approve of. A way that pleases them. It wouldn't bring them real happiness but it would leave them guiltless yet content. So when you stop walking on the sidelines and take a detour to the destination you think you belong to or transform yourself to the person you want to be. The one that really makes YOUR heart happy, you don't see a lot of takers. You don't even find many standing by your side at the end of the journey. You din't fit the bill. You can't be a part of the group coz you're now an extrovert not an introvert. You can't get trodden to the ground. You won't take everyone's bullshit and hide it in your heart but you will give an equally tough fight. Maybe tougher. You won't run to that emo corner and cry it off and emerge like you rose from the dead- So now, this confident, outgoing self is not acceptable.

13. Good Times Roll
When we allow ourselves to let go of wanting the other to fill us up, when we let ourselves be real, as we are, another energy comes through our body and being. It will charge our entire being with a presence, a force that is absolutely free of wanting. We feel open, grounded, free, humble and powerful - zero and everything. It is as through our body, heart and soul simultaneously flower in reverential awe of the moment. This force is an exquisite expression of the flower of life itself.
The Chairman of the CFR is Robert E. Rubin, who served under Bill Clinton as Treasury Secretary and headed Clinton's National Economic Council. He was a Clinton crony. Rubin's ties to Clinton are interesting, since Bill Clinton was Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University, where he was close to the Jesuit faculty (became Class President in his junior year). Rubin has served on the board of the Center for National Policy (CNP), which is led by it's President, Roman Catholic Tim Roemer (A graduate of the Roman Catholic University of Notre Dame).

What I have not found is any evidence that the motive for farm murders is "genocide". The perpetrators are sometimes caught, tried and convicted. In how many of these cases has the motive been proved to be "genocide"? If the genocide propagandists can show that this morive has been proved in the majority of cases (a 51% majority will do), then I will be prepared to take their contentions seriously. But until they do that, I will take their assertions with several bags of salt, and merely white racist propaganda. Sannie sê Sannie sal sewe sakke sout sleep.

In a frying pan, melt a small pat of butter or margarine, and place the bread slices (mayo and cheese side up) in the pan. Cook until golden brown on the bread side.
For the stock: add all ingredients to a soup pot. Pick off all the chicken that you want to eat. Put everything else in the pot. Cook about 35 to 45 minutes. Remove chicken bones, skin, etc. from pot. Remove and discard bay leaves and anything else. You should have approximately 3 quarts of stock. (Again, if you just buy chicken stock you can skip this whole apart)

The key to this entire problem was failure to understand Paul's ministry and message. Were Lysius to side with the Jews, he would be as lost as they. Fortunately, he had Paul in a semi-private audience. The Jews no longer had a gospel message for God was no longer dealing with them. To Paul was given the gospel of the grace of God for so we read in Ephesians 3:2.

When back slowly turn and bring your mirror self/reflection back towards you.

Those were the favorites and the first to disappear. Tali also ate the apples and sampled the cucumbers. Ana ate tomatoes, oranges, apples, cucumbers, and celery. She sampled the peppers. Amanda ate everything after arranging it all neatly on her plate. We didn't get to the pineapple so we'll try that at snack time.
The implication of preparing to move Russian troops not only is to protect its own vital regional interests but possibly to assist Iran in the event of such an attack. Sources add that a Russian military buildup in the region could result in the Russian military potentially engaging Israeli forces, U.S. forces, or both.
NFC West:
According to this reliable hadith, the cursing of a Muslim constitutes moral depravity. When any Muslim dares to curse another Muslim, this amounts to moral depravity - all the more so when it is done by a scholar, who is considered by some to be a source of authority in Islamic law. He dares to curse, to slander, to make unfounded accusations, and to sanction the killing, execution, and stoning of people. He uses black incitement against a Muslim. This is the height of moral depravity.
Almost the exact middle, actually. Young and school-trained London singer Woon's debut album, Mirrorwriting, sits between Katy B and James B, pop theatricality and singer-songwriter calm, club culture and bedroom indie, old-school soul and modern electronic R&B, extroverted and introverted. And tying it all together is the language of UK bass. His first major single, 2010's justly lauded "Night Air", announced him as one of a number of young English artists for whom garage, and everything that came after, was just another bit of pop language to use. And from the slow-motion jungle syncopations and muted bass blare of "Street" to the stuttering retro-rave breakbeats that drive "Spirits", the computer-assisted Woon makes sorta-pop from the last 20 years of UK dance the way current U.S. guitar kids draw from surf-rock and girl-groups.

13. Don't Call Me Anymore - 1958
I wanted to like The Final Countdown a lot more than I did. This is one script, however, that ends up just as a drama, with a couple of intriguing scenes involving aerial recon pictures and historic pictures, and another scene where that captured Japanese pilot suddenly realizes what is going on. It was so close, so often. And the very last scene with the black limo WAS clever, but you expect that at the end of an episode of "Twilight Zone". You expect MORE from all this and World War II.

The Kingdom of God starts small, a grain of wheat, a mustard seed, a leaven in the loaf. And it spreads, oh, yes, it grows. But it starts small, even hidden in the secret places, a knitting together of wonder, perhaps. A candle on a lamp stand, a woman searching for a coin, a man in a field with a treasure worth selling everything to possess.

I used to sell property and casualty insurance down in Sarasota Florida. I remember after I got licensed I was supposed to find a target niche for my prospecting efforts and develop a marketing strategy to target businesses within that niche. I picked professional liability after some quick success in that line of business and put together a prospect list of companies who I wanted to approach about writing their insurance. There was one account that I set my eyes on and really wanted to land. It was a large multi location diagnostics facility with large property and casualty exposures that would not only result in a challenge to structure but would land me a huge commission if I could write the account.
The tan color deepened to brown and spread around me. To my astonishment, the area of color developed, like a photo, into a vision of a man with chocolate-brown skin. He superimposed himself over the left side of my face and upper chest and my left arm, and I perceived him as if from the inside and the outside at the same time. I could actually see him, with technicolor clarity, something that had never, ever happened to me before. He looked to be in his mid-thirties, with very round cheeks and prominent eyes, a little like Louis Armstrong. I heard the name "Bertram."

There was that time I watched my father in a televised drama where he was portraying yet another down and out character. There was a part where he was cold and shivering and sad, and I am told I came out from under the dining table that was my favourite hiding spot and offered my blankie to the television set saying "Here daddy, you can have my blankie, you don't have to be cold!" The adults thought that was the sweetest, funniest thing ever, but to my four year old mind, my father was suffering and I wanted to help. I knew he was pretending, but could I be really, really sure he wasn't actually cold?

My theme for this month is Go Outside. Weird, possibly, but relevant, particularly since in just 21 days I will be swimming 5km for Marie Curie Cancer Care. In the last month I have done precisely no training whatever, so I'm very likely to not make my target of under an hour and a half, but I will complete the 5km, come hell or high water. I plan to go to the gym every day for the next 21 days, starting tomorrow. It's a good theme, I think. I plan to spend regular time outside or at the gym, even if it's only half an hour. Money is tight again now, but going for a walk is free and it's a good way to spend time with my kids, my man or just myself. I tend to do my best thinking in the five minutes it takes me to shower - I've come up with all sorts of speech ideas and blog posts, you wouldn't believe it. I hope that a couple of hours in the gym every day will give me lots of great thinking time and lots of fabulous ideas will flow.

When the captain of your ship tells you to do something in a somewhat frenzied or stern voice, it's almost always for your own good and everyone else's, so you should just shut your mouth and do it. And not get defensive about it.

"Of course, when one is young one has all these delusions of being the great stud and one is not interested in a harmonious relationship of giving and taking. But, I'm happy to say, those days for me are now long past and I have spent many fulfilling hours, even on this very lawn upon which I now recline, not only copulating but involved in various other activities.
We arrived in Buffalo fairly early, around 8:30ish pm, I think. We ate supper, then attempted to find a hotel. And that's where the difficulty started. The first one we tried was filthy (like really ew), and then the next half dozed or so were scented. Since both Emi and my mom are allergic to synthetic scents, it's really hard to find places that don't use stuff like Febreeze (which is really bad for everyone by the way, regardless of allergies), we have to try LOTS of hotels before we find one that we can actually stay in. Finally, at 11:30 pm, and after getting lost several times, we were stressed out, exhausted, and nearly in tears, when we finally (finally!) found a non sweet smelling hotel! Woo hoo! I took this pic the next morning.

At about ten o'clock in the morning the sun threw a bright dust-laden bar through one of the side windows, and in and out of the beam flies shot like rushing stars.You don't usually read that kind of thing in a play. But there isn't a lot of it, and so the overall effect is streamlined and minimal- no philosophical rambling or wordy imagery. Big hearts for Steinbeck in this department. I want to read more novel-plays. (Recommendations please!)
Whenever our right becomes the guiding factor of our lives, it dulls our spiritual insight. The greatest enemy of the life of faith in God is not sin, but good choices which are not quite good enough. The good is always the enemy of the best. In this passage, it would seem that the wisest thing in the world for Abram to do would be to choose. It was his right, and the people around him would consider him to be a fool for not choosing.

The Chairman of the CFR is Robert E. Rubin, who served under Bill Clinton as Treasury Secretary and headed Clinton's National Economic Council. He was a Clinton crony. Rubin's ties to Clinton are interesting, since Bill Clinton was Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University, where he was close to the Jesuit faculty (became Class President in his junior year). Rubin has served on the board of the Center for National Policy (CNP), which is led by it's President, Roman Catholic Tim Roemer (A graduate of the Roman Catholic University of Notre Dame).
After compiling a passel of such non-animation and not exclusively cartoon images, I have decided to launch them on their own blog: "Pacific SplendorLAnd", where they will not interfere with the winnowing but still vaguely animation-related ramblings here.The main thing I have enjoyed about doing these pieces is that they wind up being singular, self-contained compositions, as opposed to quick fragmented doodles on the one end of the spectrum; or artwork created as a stream of storytelling devices, such as a storyboard or an animation sequence on the other. So somehow this makes them want their own blog.
Although Chary ended up getting sick early Sunday morning I would have to say the trip was very enjoyable for everyone. I surely don't get to see Grandiose, Frisuer, and Chary nearly enough so I greatly cherish the opportunities I do get with them. I am very hopeful that Grandiose is able to make a trip up for a regular season game when the tailgating is in full force along with all of the great traditions that take place before each and every home game at Notre Dame. I am sure Frisuer and Chary will remember the experience as well. I hope to do this again next year as well, but we will have to see if we are able to make it work out again for everyone.

The yellow shoes I made were turned, literally. Made inside out, then flipped. The outer sole is stitched directly to the uppers. This style is around and fashionable for all of our time period. It is the least durable, since it cannot be re-soled and has to have a thinner sole to be able to be turned. However, this makes it the daintiest of shoe styles.

During the evenings the crickets and cicadas sing. Combined with roosters, hens, ducks, wild birds, yowling skinny cats and the nightly chorus sent up by the campus's dog population this can all add up to quite the racket at bed time. Speaking of ducks, on my walk home from the office yesterday a tiny yellow duckling waddled across the open-air hallway I was threading my way through, looking lost yet determined. I hope he's found his way to safety, it's a jungle out there.

Now that I can feel that sense of "enough" in my body, and I can trust it enough to take action around it, I don't struggle nearly as much with the wants, desires, and wishes that used to plague me. I know what is enough. For most of my life, for most things in my life, I have enough. I am enough. There is enough.

He also sought to break from the class-conscious conventions of the 1930s and early 40s, when top hat and tails or tuxedos were the norm, by dancing in casual or everyday work clothes, so as to make his dancing more relevant to the cinema-going public. As his first wife, actress and dancer Betsy Blair explained: "A sailor suit or his white socks and loafers, or the T-shirts on his muscular torso, gave everyone the feeling that he was a regular guy, and perhaps they too could express love and joy by dancing in the street or stomping through puddles.he democratized the dance in movies."[14] In particular, he wanted to create a completely different image from that associated with Fred Astaire, not least because he believed his physique didn't suit such refined elegance: "I used to envy his cool aristocratic style, so intimate and contained. Fred wears top hat and tails to the manner born - I put them on and look like a truck driver."[2]

Having a good reputation is something you want in the music business. It sounds like obvious good advice for artists to tell them to be able to play well with others, but this also needs to include others you might not like or want to play with. In todays music business, you may come across and have to work with people you don't like, they might be doing things you cant stand, but bashing them excessively online or around others is not going to help you get what you want in the end.

Dad went for a walk around when we got there and mum and i got the boys into their swimmers. Then Jordy was straight in the river and wanting to go floating off downstream. Mum had Darcy and i was still getting ready to get in and Jordy is off! Little bugger. I was a bit worried about him going over the edge of the waterfall but i met him down the end and he kicked over to me. Not that it was a big waterfall! He would not have been hurt if he went over but he might have scared himself.

Monday, February 8th was a great night. We had pizza at A Slice of Brooklyn and then we made a presentation at the 77th Precinct Community Council meeting. There were a lot of people - probably over 50. I was a little nervous because I have never done a presentation outside of school before. But, come to find out it was great and me and the other students did well.

The sheer random chance of such an encounter was part of the danger inherent in the setting. On the other hand, you could encounter a group of giant rats or one cave bear by itself. There needs to be more random elements to things while providing players, in the option of the stone giants, with the opportunity to retreat if and when needed.

But ending her relationship with the bikini company did not make Farrow any less dangerous. Her near-nakedness remained on display in places like Penthouse Magazine, FHM Magazine, and numerous other places who trade on the twisted ways of immodest women and play with the safety of the world on a regular basis. And as the years went by, Farrow started adding more tattoos to her body, making her not only an immodest women, but an immodest women who violated divine commandments by marking her body! There can be little question that she can be held responsible for the 2008 Sichuan earthquake that killed over 68,000 people in China.

Friday night we had dinner at Renaldi's on Lincoln, which was perfectly kid friendly and easy! After dinner we went back to Courtney's house for wine and bonding. Courtney has an adorable new apartment in Lincoln Park were the group stayed for the weekend.

But hey-ho! Everyone has their quiet days right? Oooo! I completely forgot that I had the new Alexander McCall Smith book to read so I will be visiting Mma Ramotswe in Botswana sometime today also! Very much looking forward to that.
The new characters were incredibly underdeveloped; Angelica, Blackbeard, the Minister, and the mermaid all felt forced upon the audience as if we were suppose to enjoy them, but realistically they were just annoying. Angelica is mad at Jack for taking her virginity (wasn't pirates suppose to be geared for Children?) Blackbeard hides in his cabin for most of the film (wasn't he the scariest pirates of all time?) the Minister falls in love with the mermaid (who in this film can shoot spiderwebs from their wrists like Spider-Man) just because he sees her naked (again, Disney, Pirates, Children?) and the Mermaid needs to shed one tear (there were enough tears of pain from the audience to solve that problem).
And manage to cut my lip on the floor.
Personally, I am a fan of books like this that help bridge the gap to help children graduate from reading Bible picture books to actually digesting Scripture. And while it is not a homeschool "curriculum", it would certainly adapt well as a Bible curriculum, especially if your family enjoys the New Living Translation. On the other hand, children this age are incredibly impressionable. They are thinking and absorbing so much. It is time to sharpen up on your theology. I have read some Bible storybooks where the stories are retold in a way that uses soft theology or even sways the story by adding (or omitting) details to the original text. The mere fact that someone picks and chooses only certain Bible stories to retell means that the person has at least some control of what the final presentation looks like. In this book, Carolyn Larsen has condensed the Scripture to retell each story, but (as you can see from the one example above) she is merely eliminating details that may cause a young brain (or even my old brain) to scatter and wander. It brings the story focus, and keeps the truth. Larsen has taken the opportunity to use the "Now What" section to tie in the big picture of the Gospel right from the beginning. For me, this is an essential element that I look for in a good book. One of the first things I did was flip to the back of the book to the stories telling of Jesus' death and resurrection and the early church. I read through the "Now What" sections looking for any details that may tell my child how or why to become saved. At first, it appeared that I wouldn't find what I was looking for. Disappointed, I flipped to Genesis. There it was. With the telling of Adam and Eve's sin, came the Gospel. Right at the beginning, exactly where it was needed. We need a Savior and here's why and here is where you can find Him.

Another thing I loved that she said is, "I'm really concerned about the little things. We haven't been asked to cross the plains, but I have asked you not to chew gum and yet some of you are still doing it. We've asked you to wear skirts that cover your knees when you are sitting and yet some of you still have skirts that are too short. I'm worried that if we can't do the little things we don't have a chance when we're asked to do the big things." I thought that was really profound.

It has also been suggested that local communities should be given the right to buy up closed pubs and run them themselves. This may work in close-knit villages in the Lake District, but it's unlikely to be of much interest to the neighbours of large urban pubs like the Four Heatons or the Southern Hotel. The most likely result if some kind of "cooling off period" is introduced for people to try to raise the money to buy them is pubs remaining closed and blighted for months with no realistic prospect of ever coming back to life. In general, local communities are more likely to want developers to get on with it and build a block of flats or a supermarket as soon as possible.
I want to start with talking about Sawyer and Kate because I believe that this relationship was arguably the more apparent of the two, definitely the more active and perhaps even the more popular choice for indifferent/casual viewers. Why? Because Sawyer and Kate together was the obvious choice, the easy choice, and the in many ways expected direction for the characters to head in.

Nursing-sadly no. Mama dried up and Jonah wasn't getting nearly enough so we weaned. It was sad but then it was freeing for me. I was either pregnant or nursing for over three years!

Let me tell you, I previously loved Gerard Butler's Phantom but Ramin Karimloo's Phantom made me want to hop through my television set, kick Christine out of the picture and run away with him on the streets of Paris. He was AMAZING with a gorgeous voice and so much raw, sexy emotion. Despite kicking her to the side for the Phantom the gorgeous Sierra Boggess was an awesome Christine with an amazingly hypnotic voice. The height of the play where they sang the theme song was filled with such romance and emotion. I also fell in love with the Music of the Night from Ramin's emotionally raw and sexy voice. I had to grab the soundtrack after to relive the experience over and over again. I simply fell in love with the production!

Did you know that in the world today there are 143 million orphans? They have no family to claim them and no parents to call their own. Many of them age out of the orphanages and become homeless, turning to drugs, suicide, or prostitution. Yet they are not without hope! The Lord cares for the orphans and following God's call in our life, we desire to give them a home, love, and a family to call their own. Please join us in praying for the orphans around the world that they would have enough food to eat, for someone to care for them, and for their protection. Please also pray that God would care for and provide for them until their adopting families can come get them. Pray that God would give us wisdom, discernment, and insight as we raise our adopted children.
It is relatively obvious that certain international business pursuits are more likely to influence environmental conditions. These types of businesses need to be especially concerned about the fashion in which they conduct business. They must assure citizens that the environment will not be tarnished for decades to come. I have no qualms about them facilitating business in an international setting, but they need to make sure that the environment doesn't become degraded as a result of their organizational operations.

This is an example of churnalism at its laziest worst. Or is it something more sinister?

That might be going too far. But it says a lot about BBC journalism that they imagined that stoning reincarnated dog lawyers to death was the sort of thing Orthodox Jews get up to.

We'd decided on going to the Cartoon Museum in London when we read about an exhibition of work by one of the greatest cartoonists of all time, H.M. Bateman. He was the man who pioneered short or no-caption drawings which were such a welcome contrast to the rather heavily laboured pieces favoured by the Edwardians and Victorians. He also did fabulous caricatures, but was best known for his series about 'The Man Who.', which included toe-curling embarrassing moments, such as a guardsman who dropped his rifle on parade and a junior officer who ate the colonel's starter at a regimental dinner. He did superb irate older men with popping monocles and incandescent eye-brows. We both laughed outright many times in the exhibition - and nobody went Shhhhh. It's a great place: very cheap to get in, an excellent shop and the show itself was superb: very well-lit and arranged and with full, detailed captions. I can report that the Cartoon Museum hasn't caught the almost universal disease of British museums who seem to think their visitors are either ill-informed half-wits, or pre-school children.

However, that being said, I totally rejected someone based on their sexual background...or rather, the sexual background that he admitted to me...after I joked that I would go out with him for "research". Which included a stint as a Chippendale dancer. Naturally, because I've seen quite a bit of porn, my first question after that reveal was "So, have you ever had sex at a party in front of everyone?" The answer was a YES - in capitals. With an explanation about how exciting it was, followed by a picture of his cock (which wasn't that impressive) and an explicit proposition. I'm pretty sure that he probably has a video of himself somewhere on the internet, and who knows, I may have seen it. Too forward, too creepy, too dangerous for me.

It's unfair to you because you may not be aware of what you are signing up for, in which case, you may host their advertisements for free without making any money. Whether or not it's ethical to post editorial content that you may make money off of is really up for grabs at this point in the blogopshere. I personally feel uncomfortable about placing advertisements in my blog unless they are clearly marked.
Friday night we had dinner at Renaldi's on Lincoln, which was perfectly kid friendly and easy! After dinner we went back to Courtney's house for wine and bonding. Courtney has an adorable new apartment in Lincoln Park were the group stayed for the weekend. Sean, Ellie, and John spent some time watching the old Muppet Movie-- getting ready for the new one out this week. We can't wait to see the muppets back on the big screen again!

I want to start with talking about Sawyer and Kate because I believe that this relationship was arguably the more apparent of the two, definitely the more active and perhaps even the more popular choice for indifferent/casual viewers. Why? Because Sawyer and Kate together was the obvious choice, the easy choice, and the in many ways expected direction for the characters to head in.

I'm sitting here at 10am in a condo that is much more empty than it was 12 hours ago. My tv is gone, my coffee table is gone, and most importantly the boxes of my exes stuff that i had hidden behind the couch for the past 5 months is gone. I didn't know how it would go today. My last relationship was a tricky one. I'd have to say it was honestly the worst and most dysfunctional relationship I've ever had in my entire life (i've had a total of 3 boyfriends).

Interspersed in the story are Sonia's memories of Seb, the young boy who Jez reminds her of. And these parts I found fairly unpleasant. Sonia was obviously enthralled by the boy and would do whatever he asked of her, somehow this willingness to be led jars with the adult Sonia who has taken control of someone else's life.

Let me tell you, I previously loved Gerard Butler's Phantom but Ramin Karimloo's Phantom made me want to hop through my television set, kick Christine out of the picture and run away with him on the streets of Paris. He was AMAZING with a gorgeous voice and so much raw, sexy emotion. Despite kicking her to the side for the Phantom the gorgeous Sierra Boggess was an awesome Christine with an amazingly hypnotic voice. The height of the play where they sang the theme song was filled with such romance and emotion. I also fell in love with the Music of the Night from Ramin's emotionally raw and sexy voice. I had to grab the soundtrack after to relive the experience over and over again. I simply fell in love with the production!

Such determination in her work life goes hand in hand with sacrifices in her social life. She often finds herself declining invites to parties or social gatherings in favour of a few more hours sewing or attending a networking event. When this happens, Judith simply reminds herself "Well they are only drinking wine, I'm not really missing out on that much". This sort of perspective has helped her throughout her career.

Now we need to get our blocks to our sewing machine to be able to sew them into rows. To do that, start with the bottom row, pick up the numbered block on the left, then pick up each block in turn until you have the whole row sitting in sewing order. Then I put that little pile on a plate. Repeat this process until you have all your rows sitting on a plate ready to be sewn. You do need to be a little careful at this point, if you trip over carrying this precious little plate of blocks, you will have to start the layout all over again!!!

He would not have been hurt if he went over but he might have scared himself.

As things stand at the moment, it is the prevailing view within the Church of England that -- to adopt a minimalist position -- God's Word on the subject of marriage is relatively clear. If there is dissent from that view in the congregation, it is therefore surely the task of the teaching office to correct it.

Billy slowly drove into Casey's driveway, and although she had been through a night of fear and terror, she felt nothing other than happiness and joy when she saw her house. It looked like heaven to Casey because she wasn't even sure if she would live to see daylight. Casey slung open the truck door and jumped out of Billy's truck in lightening speed. As she ran up to the driver's side and softly said "I know exactly what happened last night, Billy. You guys drugged me and raped me. And I will never forget it. You're going to get away with it because I am too ashamed to tell anyone what you guys did to me. You can bet your ass that God will avenge my honor. You may not go to jail, but you will suffer for what you did to me." Billy looked at her, and he was completely stunned that she remembered what had happened. This is probably due to, the fact that they gave her what they thought was a drug that would make her forget. Evidently, the effects weren't as potent as Billy had hoped.

Now, "making an example" of someone, to me, is the stuff of wartime prison camps. Not civil courts in peacetime. You cannot reasonably over-punish a high-visibility convict to deter those who might follow. Not fair. Nor, of course, could punishment by proxy be justified, supposing it were provable. Fact is, though, that a young man who clearly has some problems is being locked in with people who are more likely to supplement his trauma than to show him the way to enlightenment. And we are paying for it. I would say that the law is an ass. But I don't want to be in contempt of court, do I?

The Royal troops aren't up to much, but are no worse than the Rebels, so don't really merit being Hordes. They use a mix of swords and shields, and polearms, so you could have some Spears if you wanted. Blades seems the best all-round classification, though. The Artillery represents various fanciful weapons employed against Pulgasari, including fireball-hurling catapults, rocket batteries and some amazingly impractical cannon. A magical priestess was also used in an attempt to defeat the monster.

I spent this past weekend at a retreat at the Seabeck Conference Center. I had to smile as I drove into Seabeck. The business district, if I don't count the Conference Center, consists of only about a half a dozen buildings, but when I arrived in town I was greeted by a small gray building with a bright blue door. White trim around the window caused the red "Espresso" sign to pop. I decided to go inside. The usual rows of flavors were lined up on a shelf; an espresso machine and a barista were visible from behind a tiny counter. Five or six wooden stools filled the remaining floor space- stools that were all occupied by the locals. They are a generous lot. I discovered that they will tease anyone. They didn't penalize me for being a visitor; locals and visitors are all teased alike.
We wear the babies on our bodies in Bjorns, Moby's, or slings, as we did with A. She is a tiny three-year-old, so a month ago, I asked her if she wanted to ride in the Ergo carrier on my back, since she was feeling jealous that O-Bear was in the Bjorn, next to me. She climbed in and I wore her on my back while I made cookies. She laid her sweet blonde head onto my back and said, "Ahhh. Isn't it nice to be stuck together like glue again, Mommy?" MELT.

This has led to legal repercussions on more than one occasion. Over the past few years, I've been following closely stories relating to the legal world, and there has been a surge of cases like this one in which jurors have caused mistrials or even been subjected to contempt of court for tweeting or blogging about their experiences in court.
The day of the big dance, the twins are instructed to clean their rooms and while doing so, Elizabeth discovers George's letter to Enid. Using her mad Jessica Fletcher skillz, she finally deducts that it was her unhinged sister that told Ronnie about George. Of course, instead of confronting her like a normal person, Elizabeth begins to plot her revenge. Seeing as the last book established her unique brand of crap vengeance, she's probably just planning to hide Jessica's hairbrush or something.
And in the meantime, since I can't build a Time Machine and go back to school and get a different degree, I spend some of my time trying to get as much education as I can on subjects about communication and language as I try to understand why my son has such a problem with his.

We join together in meditation and prayer this morning seeking to realize that the fabric of our lives is woven by our own hands, every thought, every word, every action is a thread in the social tapestry.

I don't think it matters where in the world you live, supporting your local economy is important.

First of all, for those who don't know I have 3 adopted siblings. They are all from the Philippines. Actually there are six kids in my family and our order goes a bit like this - biological, adopted, biological, adopted, biological, adopted. :) My parents were also foster parents for about 8 years, so we had infants in and out of our house - most in which (I think) were adopted. So as you can tell adoption has been a pretty big part of my life. I always knew I wanted to adopt. It just seemed like something I was suppose to do when having a family. My husband's family is a bit different from mine - he's the only one! Although we came from different types of families, we both knew we wanted to have a family eventually.

I had never seen so many hippies in one place outside Central Park. We were all over the grounds and buildings, setting up tents and campsites outdoors and inside, utilizing the communal kitchen, and playing together everywhere. Perhaps what amazed me most during that week was how careful we were to keep the place clean, how nothing was trashed or damaged, how all of us were committed to leaving the grounds as we'd found them or even better.

Unaware that Sacha's brain is not wired for sex, the Baron starts to loose it. Blaming everything from the blood they used to outside agitators, the Baron is determined to get his zombies to procreate, as it's his dream to create a race of superior beings with Serbian noses.

Even more importantly I think I'm having a rebirth of my spirit. For the longest time I've basically just existed. I've done the bare minimum around the house. It's been a struggle to get that done too. But the last few weeks I've been WANTING to spread my wings and take the time to make the homemade breads and the homemade snacks. I've been wanting to do that stuff. It's almost like I'm being reborn. I don't know what has brought this about. I'm afraid to blink...afraid that it will go away if I do. I still have all the stress and depression in my life....but I'm really trying to not let it affect ME. And maybe that's the whole difference.

By the time Douglas Jardine's Bodyline series came around, Bradman was only 24 and had already scored 2695 runs in 19 Tests at 112.3 with 12 centuries, including the world record score of 334. The Bodyline was his weakest series but he still managed 396 runs in 4 games at an average of 56.75 (higher than the career averages of Lara, Tendulkar, Chappell, Gavaskar and Ponting). He scored 12 double centuries in just 80 innings and registered a further seven 150+ scores. His tragically legendary average of 99.94 is one of the most widely known sport statistics worldwide. He is not just the greatest batsman in cricket history but also one of the greatest sportspersons ever, with the Time magazine rating him alongside the likes of Muhammad Ali, Babe Ruth, Juan Manuel Fangio and Pele. Bradman is much more than an icon or a hero; he is a figure that transcends the game he played and stands for something much greater than that. Bradman is the epitome of the pinnacle of human achievement in sports.
You were given to me by my second oldest sister back in the days when I was not such a food nerd.

You only had a two year warranty, and, to be honest, I didn't think you'd last past it.

In the Guardian article, Eagleman and Tallis briefly highlight their differences. In essence, the conversation summarizes Tallis's objections to what he calls the "radical thesis" of Eagleman's book Incognito (reviewed here last July). Tallis accuses Eagleman of limiting the human experience to a mechanical, "zombie" set of brain processes. Rather, Tallis argues, while our mental processes certainly require a brain, they are essentially social experiences, so that studying brain activity is ultimately uninformative. Eagleman agrees that much of our experience is external and social, but he concentrates on how those external interactions change the way the brain works.

Sources add that a Russian military buildup in the region could result in the Russian military potentially engaging Israeli forces, U.S. forces, or both.
"Our results suggest that long-term meditators have white-matter fibers that are either more numerous, more dense or more insulated throughout the brain," Dr. Luders said in a statement to the media. "We also found that the normal age-related decline of white-matter tissue is considerably reduced in active meditation practitioners."
It is relatively obvious that certain international business pursuits are more likely to influence environmental conditions. These types of businesses need to be especially concerned about the fashion in which they conduct business. They must assure citizens that the environment will not be tarnished for decades to come. I have no qualms about them facilitating business in an international setting, but they need to make sure that the environment doesn't become degraded as a result of their organizational operations.

Ok, so I know I've already done a section on Bendis' New Avengers (and The Mighty Avengers)but I feel like a wanna do a brief recap as #26-#31 as just been collectively released as 'REVOLUTION'. I'm a big fan of The New Avengers,but I gotta say it reads better in trade form than it does in single issues(lets be honest,most of Bendis' single issues you can read in less than 5 minutes),the flashback style narritive sits a lot easier and the constant scapes with Electra and the Hand makes it a lot pacier and this is easily the best storyline since 'BREAKOUT'(ok, you gotta love 'Secrets and Lies').

New, punitive and potentially invasive laws such as the London Olympic Games Act 2006 are in force. This legitimise the use of force, potentially by private security companies, to proscribe Occupy-style protests. They also allow Olympic security personnel to deal forcibly with the display of any commercial material that is deemed to challenge the complete management of London as a "clean city" to be branded for the global TV audience wholly by prime corporate sponsors (including McDonald's, Visa and Dow Chemical).

Me: "Are you serious?"
Despite an interest in mechanical things I never took a high school shop class nor any type of engineering or similar college class. However, about ten years after college, I taught myself woodworking and went on to a career building furniture and writing about woodworking topics. My first writing gigs were ... technical and do-it-yourself articles for magazines.
If you buy into the idea of an economic collapse that allows some sort of plausible, individualistic retreat scenario, you are probably also going to like Crawford's EMP scenarios, even if the most obvious EMP scenarios would normally include enough regular style nukes to melt the planet.
Because that's how blogging works: I offer an endless supply of overshared details from my personal life and you voyeuristically consume them. Duh.

Sometimes the most exciting thing that happens involves wire, mesh and a recalcitrant dishwasher named Paco.
It's unfair to you because you may not be aware of what you are signing up for, in which case, you may host their advertisements for free without making any money. Whether or not it's ethical to post editorial content that you may make money off of is really up for grabs at this point in the blogopshere. I personally feel uncomfortable about placing advertisements in my blog unless they are clearly marked.
Even though it was quite disappointing for we the children, the parents especially the mothers were happy because it spared them the trouble of waking up at dawn to cook the Ampesi, Banku, Konkonte, Mpotopoto, Tuo Zaafi (Ghanaian dishes). Did I hear you say, you sent the Fried Rice and Chicken, Potato chips and Chicken and burgers? Hmm, my dear friend, this was what I dreamt of sending to Our Day. Nevertheless, Our Day was still fun. There were lots of toffees, chocolate, biscuits, cookies, drinks and delicious food from the school's canteen. The one who made my Our Day always memorable was one of my favourite teachers, Mr. Quartey. He was my class 5 teacher. He loved to pamper me and my squad (P.I.A - don't ask for the meaning). It wasn't that we were teachers' pets but... aha we had favour from our teachers.

Jackie: Well, that's a tough one to answer because we don't actually know ourselves yet! I can say that we are currently writing new material and are thinking that these newest songs might appear on a 7" split or maybe a vinyl EP sometime in 2009. We also have a possible European tour in the works, but nothing is final. Long term, we just want to keep rollin'. Another album, more tours, more fun for us!

But Tom Hiddleston. Man, is Tom Hiddleston good. He plays Loki the same way he played the character in Thor, not as a cartoon villain but as an at times sympathetic man torn between the way he regards his brother with both familial love and burning jealousy. There are scenes between Thor and Loki where you can almost see Loki willing to put an end to all of this, but too far in to stop now. Loki is not absolutely a villain, and none of the heroes are absolutely heroes. They all have doubts and moments of cynicism. It's what elevates the movie beyond merely a collection of character moments and an action-packed third act: the continuing thread about what the nature of heroism really is, where it comes from, and how it can be used to affect the world. It was there in Captain America: The First Avenger when Steve Rogers told Dr. Erskine "I don't want to kill anybody. I don't like bullies. I don't care where they're from." It was there when Thor learned how to wield his power for others and Tony Stark conquered his daddy issues.
I don't know if this piece has any kind of value today. Maybe the fact that the whole set is now dismantled, must decrease its value. And although such ensemble was (and still is) far from cheap, my mom paid only half of its retail value because she could get it directly from the factory where one of her friend worked back then.

Written for ages 6 and older this is one of many delightful books in the Katie Woo series. I no longer have children or grandchildren this age but the title reminded me of my 8-year-old granddaughter (kind of a Madame Fullcharge) and I thought she and I would have fun reading it together. She wasn't interested. Said it was too young for her. That might be because she just finishing up her 4th grade brothers book, Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief. Anyway I thought the book was great and I still think she would have enjoyed it. I'll bet if I could have figured out how to get it onto Kindle she may have read it.
Note: don't expect the dough to rise during this period - remember, it's not a yeast bread, and by definition unleavened ('chappa' means flattened in Tamil). I assumed this was more of a "rest" period for the gluten and what not in the flours to react with the water. Other chapati recipes online, however, don't include the hour rest period, so if you're in a rush I'm tempted to say you could skip it.
Preheat oven to 500 F. In small bowl, mix butter and garlic, set aside. Roll dough out into a 12" circle on parchment paper. Spread butter and garlic mix over dough. Sprinkle with parmesan followed by mozzarella cheeses. Transfer parchment and dough to pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake 9-10 min.

How does this event foreshadow the ministry of the Levites? (As we will see later, the Levites will be chosen of all the tribes of Israel to attend to the Tabernacle and the religious service. "Then Moses said, 'You have been set apart to the Lord today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day." (Exodus 32:29 NIV))
The biggest emotion, though, is probably regret. Even though I was at the hospital several different times the week before he died, I never found the courage to really talk to him, to tell him that I forgave him for all the bad stuff. For the most part, I put all that behind me a long time ago, and focused on remembering the good times, the memories that can still make me smile. And that man is the one I miss, the man I wish was still here for Amy, to walk her down the aisle, to spoil our grandchildren, to sing to them.....

I also feel a change coming in me. I prefer to stay at home, or go for a quiet dinner, or watch a movie. I don't like clubbing anymore, or going and getting "wasted" which is what most of my friends do. Nothing wrong with that at all. But I am just not there anymore. My idea of a good night out now is relaxing at home with a good movie, or going to a cinema, or cooking dinner, or going out to eat. If alcohol must be involved, a nice quiet bar where we can sit and talk.
I went to the front desk and explained what happened and luckily they did give us a room (it would have been a long trip home!). We got the same type of room, same rate, but it was a handicapped accessible room. They probably hold those rooms back in case they are needed. I don't know yet if I got charged for our missed night. I had reserved the room with a card that I subsequently canceled (due to fraud). So I don't know if they would have been able to charge it or not.

She has had several nights of strange waking that's not really waking. She sometimes sits up, even says something, then collapses again with a snore. A couple times I put her on the changing table to do some saline drops in the nose, she would count the drops like she always does ("1, 2, 3, 4 drops" "other side"), but then she would instantly be quiet, and her breathing maintained the deep rhythm, even though it was labored. Then in 5 seconds, startling again. So weird.

After passing a few awful sicknesses back and forth we are ready for spring more than ever! Today was chilly but the sun was shining and the birds were chirping...so it's coming. This past weekend I put the remainder of the "winter" decorations away and made room for a couple new springy plants.
For me it didn't get bad until after the D&C. I suppose I assumed that it would be the same this time. But then I have to remind myself that it was almost as if I had 3 weeks to deal with the shock of it all before I actually "lost" my baby. This time I knew that I couldn't deal with the emotional turmoil associated with waiting for things to happen naturally as my body obviously has a very difficult time letting go. I gave myself one day to let in soak in, to say goodbye to my sweet child, and then took Cytotec again (which this time didn't even make me bleed at all) and had the D&C on Thursday.
"Since Anne Waldman gathered 31 poets at the very first marathon on January 2, 1974, countless forward-facing luminaries have thrown their voices into the cauldron - among them Eric Bogosian, William S.

Let's examine the second half of the video. One protester calls out 'Mic check!,' and everyone knows what this means. This guy will speak for us, he has something to say. And if they disagree, they can simply stop passing this person's words along. But in this case he speaks words of de-escalation. We will let you police leave. He's teaching the police a lesson in non-violence. It's amazing to see this at work.
Then as the conversation wasn't really going to settle anywhere and it was already getting late, I just moved them on to starting to prep the weeks passage. Esther said, we need to talk. So they went into doing personal time with the text and we talked in someone's room. She was visibly distraught and shared her heart that she was upset in the unbelief that had been coming out in our discussion of what to do about large group. At first I was a little taken aback but as she shared her heart and I reflected back on the conversation, I could see that she was right. We had but Jesus back into a box declaring for him what he could/couldnt do in and through our new people hours after having taken him our of the box at fall con. I felt convicted of my own desire to appease people and unbelief of how Jesus could work at UCI. So we came back together with our leaders and Esther shared her heart, her Holy discontent at what had just transpired and it led to a time of repentance from all of our leaders. That would have been cool enough but in the midst of that time, Jesus ministered to the leader I had prayed with at Fall Con by calling out some of the lies he believed about himself being the weak link in the group as we all affirmed him. It was a beautiful moment of the Holy Spirit doing what was on its agenda, not ours. Please pray that we continue to be open to the interruption of the Spirit.

The horror in and around sports rose to previously unimagined depths -- the empire struck back, the dark side reigned.

Fan favorites left town. Legends went on trial. Concussions. Perjury. PEDs.

I started with Indus, an IPA. It looked to be pouring a bit flat and it took a bit of coaxing to get a loose-bubbled head to form on the top. It didn't last long. However the beer really benefits from the low carbonation as it creates a wonderful cask-like effect, with just enough sparkle to push the flavours out. Naturally enough, it's hops out front: good honest English varieties by the taste of them, with lots of floral orange blossom laid on quite intensely, creating almost a resinous burn while staying clean and crisp, avoding all harshness. At 4.6% ABV it's around a percentage point weaker than the likes of White Shield and Bengal Lancer, but I'd regard it as being very much in the same league. The balance of marmalade and toffee you get in the others isn't present here, but the hop punchiness makes up for it for me. Tangy, sinkable and with a lasting bitterness, I really enjoyed it.
Can you tell from my reviews recently that it is getting colder outside? I truly love this time of year for beer. Don't get me wrong I love a good APA or IPA in the summer, but even more I enjoy a fine stout or porter during the colder months of the year. I've got a few bottles of this beer and this is my first one in a very long time for review. I am enjoying this beer while watching my Alma Mater Ball State keep their win streak alive against Miami of Ohio.

SkyWest's total operating revenues increased $55.2 million, or 6.4%, during the quarter ended March 31, 2012, over the same period in 2011. The increase in operating revenues was the result of higher pass-through costs (primarily fuel and engine overhaul costs) under SkyWest's agreements with its major partners and an increase in block hour production. The increase in operating revenues was offset by a planned reduction in prorate flying block hours of 13.4% resulting in reduced revenues of approximately $6.0 million. In spite of the reducing operating revenues from prorate flying, SkyWest's revenue per available seat mile for this flying increased 14.6% from improved pricing. After excluding the increased pass-through costs of approximately $31.1 million, for fuel and engine overhauls, and the reduction in prorate flying revenue of $6.0, total operating revenues increased approximately $30.1 million due to the additional block hour production of 3.1% and improved utilization. Total block hours for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 were 556,421 compared to 539,910 for the same period last year.

While I was away, my middle son Tim has completed his college courses at UNCW and has moved home in between starting his internship in Washington DC mid-January. He graduates in May with his degree in Recreation Therapy. He had a nice surprise waiting for me when I pulled into the driveway at 11PM two days before Christmas. The lighted deer and Christmas tree were in the front yard set up and glowing, attached to the Christmas lights lining the front porch my oldest son, Kerry Lee, had helped me put up during the warm spell right after Thanksgiving. Then when I came into the house I saw that Tim had set up and decorated the Christmas tree, hung the Christmas stockings for everyone including the dogs and cats, and had decorated the rest of the house as well! What a blessing!

Funny I didn't need that book cause I was entertained the whole time I was in the air. You know you don't want to stare at the other passengers but you do. And you try and not think 'please don't sit by me" but you do. I scored with no babies next to me screaming (although there was an adorable screamer in front of me) . And the nice Scottish man in front of that baby.was so not impressed. The little one thought his head was a play toy. While he kept saying 'ma'am, ma'am' to get Moms attention.Mom and Dad kept slamming back beers and Vodka. We were on our way to Vegas!

SkyWest's total operating revenues increased $55.2 million, or 6.4%, during the quarter ended March 31, 2012, over the same period in 2011. The increase in operating revenues was the result of higher pass-through costs (primarily fuel and engine overhaul costs) under SkyWest's agreements with its major partners and an increase in block hour production. The increase in operating revenues was offset by a planned reduction in prorate flying block hours of 13.4% resulting in reduced revenues of approximately $6.0 million. In spite of the reducing operating revenues from prorate flying, SkyWest's revenue per available seat mile for this flying increased 14.6% from improved pricing. After excluding the increased pass-through costs of approximately $31.1 million, for fuel and engine overhauls, and the reduction in prorate flying revenue of $6.0, total operating revenues increased approximately $30.1 million due to the additional block hour production of 3.1% and improved utilization. Total block hours for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 were 556,421 compared to 539,910 for the same period last year.
Singer Dionne Warwick showed that the way to San Jose isn't the only thing she's not familiar with, as she pawed in bewilderment at the cash register. Actress and deaf person Marlee Matlin conveniently forgot a lifetime of lip-reading so she could have a sign-language interpreter serve as a go-between in case anyone was tempted to yell at her. Supermodel Niki Taylor tossed pizza dough into the air, actually catching it on the way down a few times.
Covey amplifies his message by means of wide-ranging examples of "third alternative thinkers". There's the local police force that transformed a crime-plagued community by casting off its entrenched "them against us" mentality. Another example tells the tale of a father who, during the course of one extraordinary evening, rescued his daughter from years of clinical depression. Then there's the judge who brought a swift and peaceful end to a massive environmental lawsuit without setting foot in a courtroom.
I am truly blessed to be able to do the work I do. Over the years, my practice has evolved to the point where it is now about 50% Life Coaching and 50% Business Coaching.

She is taking her ugly duckling status hard. She shrieks her Skeksis complaint call at everyone and everything. The serama have taken to hiding from her, and even the other pekins are giving her a wide berth. The newspaper on the coop floor feels the brunt of her temper, and she is spending a lot of time shrieking in the coop and flinging strips of mutilated broadsheet out of the pop hole door. The others wisely let her go to bed first, and only venture in to the coop when she's settled down to sleep. No one risks perching next to her. To add insult to injury, I have smothered her in mite powder as a precaution. So now she looks like a middle aged, balding goth with dandruff. It's a hard look to rock, frankly.
The consequence I came up with for Gil's recent behavior is a 7 o'clock bedtime. Did I mention he does not like that? At all? At first I wasn't going to let him read in bed, but it's pretty hard to declare LIGHTS OUT! when, well, it's still light out.

Hello again! Just another quick update to keep you all up to speed.
So I pondered and scratched out various possibilities, and casually read through various texts by and about Che or Abe, wondering what the most suggestive, poetic and concise way of connecting these two men across time and history could be, until one day I hit on something that I just knew was right. It was a quote, by Che, in reference to his trip to New York City in 1964 to address the United Nations' General Assembly. It seems that while he was in New York there were two attempts on his life, one by a man wielding a gun and one by a woman with a knife. When asked about these attacks by a journalist, he is said to have responded with a smile and a bemused wisecrack: "It is better to be killed by a woman with a knife than a man with a gun" said Che.
It isn't a hiding place. It is a finding place.

Besides, isn't state-ism itself a religion for most Americans? Do they not honor the state above all else, above even the commandments of a conventional religion they may embrace? If their religion tells them "thou shalt not murder," but the state orders them to murder, then they murder. If the state tells them to rob, to destroy property, and to imprison innocent people, then, notwithstanding any religious strictures, they rob, destroy property, and imprison innocent people, as millions of victims of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and millions of victims of the so-called Drug War in this country will attest. Moreover, in every form of adversity, Americans look to the state for their personal salvation, just as before the twentieth century their ancestors looked to Divine Providence.

But all is not so well in a number of other cases. Holt paid debut novelist Jed Rubenfeld $800,000 for The Interpretation of Murder, gave away 10,000 advance-review copies, conducted a major publicity blitz, and did a first printing of 185,000 copies. The book was published almost six months ago, and, at last report, had moved about 26,000 copies. I calculate that Mr. Rubenfeld's unearned portion of the $800,000 is roughly $732,400.

In fact, a salad this good far outshines the name "taco" salad. After all, there's no lunch lady ice cream scoop of ground beef. No deep friend shell. No crumbled Fritos or cheddar cheese. Oh no. While those ingredients usually make other taco salads palatable, they would do nothing but disgrace the mere existence of this salad.

All of the above started flying at me through the phone. Remember, she's never even met him or seen the amount of vomit coming out of him.

SHE was stressing me out and that isn't helping for milk supply either.

I followed my parent's home, even though they weren't aware of my presense. My mom wept all the way while my dad remained silent. He begged my mom to calm down but it all fell on deaf ears. We got home to find the house filled with friends and relatives, my Dad carried my body and laid it on the mat in the living room. Prayers for forgiveness were said, and my parents were advised to stop crying as it wouldn't bring me back. I watched my Mom cry and weep all night as she asked God why He Had to take my life.
During the cooking demo, Chef Stefano prepared 3 dishes for us to try - Artichokes Frittata, Seafood Risotto and Milk Risotto with Cherry Parfait. I enjoyed them all, but my favorites has to be both the risotto dishes as I have a soft spot for risotto.

I really enjoy the Windsor's scones, too. They always have two choices of tasty scones, a seasonal one such as cranberry or pumpkin and a classic one like maple or oat. They are very good. Not the best I've had (that honor would go to these incredible scones I had in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn, I think it was at Choice Greene, this magical artisanal cheese, grocer, baker and charcuterie shop near BAM, scones that were so authentically British and perfect in every way, they were better than some I've had in England! I also love the very Scottish/Irish scones at Babington's Tea Room in Rome, which are dry and dense and crumbly and are served with freshly whipped clotted cream and Italian strawberry jam. Babington's is a 19th-century tea room started up by two Englishwomen and it's like stepping back in time. Some noted British food critics have claimed it's more of an "English tea experience than one you'll find in London, very classic."

The race organisers couldn't help the weather, but there was a lot throughout the day which showed that given the warning they had about the likelihood of poor weather, they could have performed a whole heap better than they did. This became abundantly clear from the start as only one entrance to the stadium was open though two were advertised in the programme - this meant all runners trying to get in and out through one gate. Pandemonium. At about this time - still with half an hour to go - organisers were trying to chivee everyone out of the stadium to start lining up at the start in the cold and wet.
I was reading something about trust the other day and I apologize for not remembering where I read it or who to give credit to but the thought has been percolating in my mind so much so I had to write about it in my own words.
But even getting out officially isn't easy. I believe that the US and its allies don't really give a tinker's curse about Afghanistan; as far as they are concerned, if the Afghans are intent on living in a barbaric medieval theocracy, where women are treated as chattels, those who don't share the faith of the rulers live in fear of death, and there're more or less continual low-level wars between various tribes, then they're welcome to do so. Admittedly, there is the poppy problem - Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of non-pharmaceutical grade opiates (92% in 2007) and also, incidentally, the world's largest producer of hashish - but, despite all the hype about the so-called War on Drugs, I have a feeling that (for all sorts of reasons, many sordid, which I won't go into here) the US and most other countries can live with that. No, the real problems are the two 500 pound
My memoir on adopting my daughter from China was perhaps the hardest thing I ever wrote mainly because at the same time that I was trying to understand what was going on, what this sudden unexpected journey in the middle of my life actually meant, to capture in words what it actually felt like- I was trying to get others to understand, to feel all of this at the same time.

The key to this entire problem was failure to understand Paul's ministry and message. Were Lysius to side with the Jews, he would be as lost as they. Fortunately, he had Paul in a semi-private audience. The Jews no longer had a gospel message for God was no longer dealing with them. To Paul was given the gospel of the grace of God for so we read in Ephesians 3:2.

Now we need to get our blocks to our sewing machine to be able to sew them into rows. To do that, start with the bottom row, pick up the numbered block on the left, then pick up each block in turn until you have the whole row sitting in sewing order. Then I put that little pile on a plate. Repeat this process until you have all your rows sitting on a plate ready to be sewn. You do need to be a little careful at this point, if you trip over carrying this precious little plate of blocks, you will have to start the layout all over again!!!

Ok, here's where I encountered some problems. Notice how the sides of my cake are SUPER brown, whereas the top is a nice green. This is bad. It makes the sides really tough.

Liverworts, like mosses contain no vascular systems to transport water and nutrients throughout the plant. This means they are most likely to be found in damp shady locations. Not surprisingly, wherever you find liverworts, there is bound to be mosses as well. Although liverwort like shade, they also require enough sunlight to conduct photosynthesis.

Eating Disorders are serious, life-threatening illnesses - not choices - and it's important to recognize the pressures, attitudes and behaviors that shape the disorder. Would you recognize if your friend or family member had an eating disorder? Parents, siblings and close friends play a significant role in guiding and supporting someone with an eating disorder. In many cases, individuals with eating disorders cannot recognize a need for help in themselves, and it takes a strong, caring individual to reach out. Most importantly, you need to know that there is hope. For those seeking recovery for a loved one, eating disorder treatment is available.
I'm Unschooled. Yes, I Can Write. celebrated it's third birthday yesterday (though there wasn't much celebrating since I didn't realize until today that yesterday was the third anniversary of this blog!). When I started writing it, I had a vague idea that I wanted to prove to both myself, and whatever rare reader stumbled across my blog, that unschoolers really do learn things all the time. That unschooling really "works." But as I grew more confident in unschooling, and as my writing/blogging skills improved, I started to focus less on my-unschooling-life-as-it-happens, and more on the philosophy of unschooling, using my life to illustrate the points I was trying to make. I enjoyed (and still enjoy) writing that type of post. Apparently, so do other people! I started, as most blogs do, with virtually no readers (family doesn't count). And now, three years later, just through Blogger's follower tracker (which only counts people who have a Blogger account and choose to follow this blog through their account) I have nearly 430 followers. This blog's Facebook page has over 1,800 fans. This blog has gotten big! And through blogging, I'm speaking at a conference again this fall (possibly two, as I've been invited to a vague conference that may or may not be happening in Montreal, as well), am recognized by name at most education things I go to, and have been asked (though whether I say yes or not depends on a lot of things) for film, radio, article, and blog post interviews.
Sickness: social status accorded to the ill person by society
Well, we never made that myrtle. The problem wasn't the hogs busting us. It was the coyote. One old mangy dog was loitering around the herd. These pigs were big enough not to be bothered by a pesky song dog, but they certainly took notice of him after he caught wind of our activities and bounded away. The coup de grace, though, were the turkeys. A couple hens were holding sentry and naturally took off when they saw us, taking the finally-frightened hogs with them. Wild pigs don't have the best sense of sight, but they're wary enough to recognize something amiss. (And how strange is it to find a coyote, hogs, and turkeys hanging around each other outside of a Disney movie?)
The Woman in the Window
It is relatively obvious that certain international business pursuits are more likely to influence environmental conditions. These types of businesses need to be especially concerned about the fashion in which they conduct business. They must assure citizens that the environment will not be tarnished for decades to come. I have no qualms about them facilitating business in an international setting, but they need to make sure that the environment doesn't become degraded as a result of their organizational operations.

I learned about Oh My Melodies from Espousal Records' Kyoungmo Kim as he updated me on the current whereabouts of the members of emo pop band I Love JH. I was instantly charmed by what I heard and returned to listen every now and then. Recently this has happened more frequently, and for reasons that will become obvious tomorrow I found the perfect opportunity to find out more about Oh My Melodies straight from the source:
Geraldo made a statement that African American & Latino parents should know better than to let their children walk around with hoodies on because people will fear them. That's the hood will give people cause to arrest, frisk and/or harass them. He actually stated that the hoodie was as much to blame for Trayvon's murder as is Zimmerman. Yes, you read that right! This fool not only said, but then he tweeted it! Okay, well guess what? Zimmerman is not a police officer. Trayvon did not need to keep his hands and face in plain view of Zimmerman. Zimmerman sought him out and approached him. Trayvon didn't put his hoodie on until he felt someone following him. Before that he was a teenager walking down the street in a sweatshirt on a cold rainy night. Unless the boy was picking a lock or peering through someone's window, I'm not sure how he falls under a suspicious category. So its actually NOT the hoodie's fault.it's actually the ignorant vigilante's fault this boy is dead!

Biologists generally agree, however that one feature above all others defines the orchid and differentiates it from virtually all other flowering plants - the fusion of the male portion of the flower (stamens) and the female portion (pistils). Orchid flowers are pollinated by a great variety of flying animals, and their diversity in floral structure has resulted from adaptations to various pollinators. About half the orchid species are pollinated by bees; moths, butterflies, flies, birds, and other agents pollinate the rest. Many orchid flowers are adapted for pollination by a single species of insect.

Every time the subject of marriage comes up, I have to shake my head at the single girls I know. Some of them are younger than I am, some of them are my age, some older. They all want that holy grail of dating and relationships - a husband. It's like some crowning achievement. An end game. Life would only be complete if I had a husband.

But it's not. Most school chicken nuggets have at least a zillion ingredients. Okay, I exaggerate. Maybe they have thirty-five. Modified corn starch, soy, beef extract and maltodextrin - among other things - are not something I'd want any human to have in moderation. The same goes for cupcakes. I'm not against cake, and I'm not against most traditions. Just the last two weekends I let my son sing happy birthday and consume cake. But it was my choice. I was there to be his "judgment," and he ate confections. But I also know he's not likely to eat cake for another whole year. The birthdays for the February 2010 babies from my mommy groups are all done, and so is the cake. I don't have to worry about every neighborhood parent running down to the local grocery and bringing a sugar, corn syrup and white flour treat right to his preschool desk.

It was such a joyous time to bond with them and appreciate every miraculous thing about them. They were beautiful, amazing little beings and I could stare at them forever.

The Kingdom of God starts small, a grain of wheat, a mustard seed, a leaven in the loaf. And it spreads, oh, yes, it grows. But it starts small, even hidden in the secret places, a knitting together of wonder, perhaps. A candle on a lamp stand, a woman searching for a coin, a man in a field with a treasure worth selling everything to possess.
Right - that's your lot, i'm keeping this one short and sweet this week (well, as short as Moi could manage anyway!).

What is your problem,
It just so happened that the idea of dissociative disorders were just beginning to be formed by psychologists in the late 1800s. Starting in the 1880s, to be more exact. Prior to this, these types of episodes as RLS describes in Jekyll and Hyde would have been attributed to demon possession, but psychologists were just realizing that traumatic events in life could cause long-term disorders. It was into this intellectual field that Jekyll and Hyde sprang, and it changed the way psychology looked at dissociative identity disorders.
Start from today, don't "save" anything for "special occasions".
We stood outside their house and hugged and prayed over them. I held each of them tight until they cried. They needed a mother's love and protection and the feel of safet, if only for a moment. I kissed them all over their faces and told them I loved them and we would see them again, and help them in the meantime. Isabelle and Johnny begged to give them all the food we had in the van, so we asked them to walk back with us. We walked down that path to the van, praying the whole way. I didn't know until later that night after looking at the pictures that we were all holding hands. Isabelle and Johnny love these girls too, and their hearts were broken and changed that day too.

An early start for this one at the northern end of Bassenthwaite Lake. There was a heavy mist when I first arrived which slowly lifted. This is twenty minutes from my home so I'm often at the lake's shores with my camera. Very peaceful on this particular morning; did not see a soul.
She is taking her ugly duckling status hard. She shrieks her Skeksis complaint call at everyone and everything. The serama have taken to hiding from her, and even the other pekins are giving her a wide berth. The newspaper on the coop floor feels the brunt of her temper, and she is spending a lot of time shrieking in the coop and flinging strips of mutilated broadsheet out of the pop hole door. The others wisely let her go to bed first, and only venture in to the coop when she's settled down to sleep. No one risks perching next to her. To add insult to injury, I have smothered her in mite powder as a precaution. So now she looks like a middle aged, balding goth with dandruff. It's a hard look to rock, frankly.
Chill Out. I have never created a clear layout so when I saw the Hambly Screen Prints transparency included in the kit, I decided to use it as the base of my page. I really like the result.

BOYCOTT AMERICAN WOMEN!
How can I do that? Did you happen to read my entry from yesterday? It goes along quite well with this thought. I must practice three things: justice, mercy and humility. All three are admirable traits in royalty. Isn't it what you envision when you think of a king, queen, prince or princess?

There are experts who believe that taking even one drink may be endangering the health of the developing baby. One thing is clear, when an expectant mother has an alcoholic beverage- a beer, a glass of wine or a cocktail- her unborn child takes the same drink. It goes directly through her bloodstream and into the placenta.
Although we are not experiencing the full effect of the cyclone the Kruger National Park has had some very heavy rain and the consequences, although damaging are quite spectacular.
So that's the excitement for today.

Almost the exact middle, actually. Young and school-trained London singer Woon's debut album, Mirrorwriting, sits between Katy B and James B, pop theatricality and singer-songwriter calm, club culture and bedroom indie, old-school soul and modern electronic R&B, extroverted and introverted. And tying it all together is the language of UK bass. His first major single, 2010's justly lauded "Night Air", announced him as one of a number of young English artists for whom garage, and everything that came after, was just another bit of pop language to use. And from the slow-motion jungle syncopations and muted bass blare of "Street" to the stuttering retro-rave breakbeats that drive "Spirits", the computer-assisted Woon makes sorta-pop from the last 20 years of UK dance the way current U.S. guitar kids draw from surf-rock and girl-groups.

This book really was a pleasure to read, a pick up any time kind of read, in between cooking tea or bathing the kids. In fact it took me less than 24 hours to read this book! I've read a lot of stories of abuse over the last few years, to the point that they started to be unshockable. It was nice to have a different take on a child in care. While Cathy as a foster mother is obviously an official role, you wouldn't get a story like this from other 'officials' eg: social workers.

This film is crazy but there is streak of dark humour running through it all. Rupert Everett narrates Francesco's thoughts throughout the film, including his meditations on the meaning of life death and love. Francesco is never a nice person but I don't get this modern obsession with creating likeable protagonists. I love this film and I know other people may not. If you like Italian horror or zombie films you may enjoy this too
"His raucous singing, grating voice, inane grin, horrible, unfunny films, and constant twanging on the most unmelodic instrument ever invented, scraped on the nerves like a hollow tooth and made George the worst artist this country has ever produced.

Maybe Facebook should hire Thomas Friedman to do its ads. His ad for Coursera (h/t Indyanna's comment at Historiann's) column on online education pretty much explains why the 100,000-person online class and the flipped classroom, with local professors as glorified tutors, is the way to go. The comments are good, and they ask the same questions we've all been asking and come to some similar conclusions.

When you think you have everything in place, we enter phase four. It is now time to take several different exposures, some that are normal and a little over, including varying the f-stop to change the focal point of the photograph.
Funny business this children-thing. My only (somewhat incoherent) conclusion is that you must do what you must do and get on with it the very best you can.
I have read through the Internet and came out with some conclusions. Firstly, all films are manipulative on some level but the way they handle it is how you distinguish whether they are subtle or heavy-handed. Now these two words are pretty ambiguous and they are rather the absolute so I think it is safe to say that no film is fully subtle or no film is fully heavy-handed. In fact, a lot of films, good or bad, is a mix and mash of both and it can be quite indiscernible most of the time. There are, however, films and cartoons that lean heavily towards each spectrum and I will try to give some examples below.
You sabotage healthy relationships
If you are a woman, and you hold Friedrich Nietzsche in high esteem as one of the great enlightened thinkers of modern philosophy, there is a decent chance you might be unfamiliar with the full extent of the man's musings about the fairer sex. Since his own lifetime, the philosopher has been accused of promoting misogynistic ideas in his writings, due to his tendency of abrasively referring to women-and femininity as a whole-in largely hostile terms (as we shall explore shortly). However, it should be stated for the sake of objectivity, that this sentiment is not universally accepted amongst prominent female authors and thinkers, as some of these individuals interpret Nietzsche's apparently sexist aphorisms as a rhetorical strategy, used to illustrate the vain construct men have of women, and the potential to possibly move beyond this simplistic sentiment.[1] Whether any of these more favorable interpretations are viable positions in light of Nietzsche's own words, or simply attempts to exonerate the philosopher of the charge of misogyny, is the focus of the analysis that follows below. Although Nietzsche never wrote a single cumulative work on the topic of womanhood, his books are nevertheless filled with countless critiques and examinations of the female psych, thereby making it possible for the reader to gather a coherent impression of the philosopher's views on women, and gender relations in general.

A movie like Red Tails which narrates the lives of such upstanding historical figures are exactly what the African-American society wants to see in the Big Screen. We're constantly bombarded with negative, & comical depictions of our selves to see a film with respectable figures that reflect us is immensely relieving.
I'm going to privatize my past posts so this will be the only one on the page. I'm keeping the name - penghost - but not the slogan. Again, though, this is only a hiatus. I'm just taking a break. I'm not giving up on blogging. I just need to find my coherent blogging zen, I guess.
The Territory is often referred to as the 'Top End' and is also home to 'the Alice' and 'the Red Centre'. It has plenty of 'Outback' and 'Dreamtime Land' and a rather large portion of extreme 'bugger all'. Rainforests and deserts, long gun barrel straight highways, magnificent picture postcard scenery and two centres of population - Darwin at the top bit and Alice Springs in the middle. That's about it.

Anyway, I thought it would be fun to keep this one under raps... a secret project that would only be revealed once it was complete! I have hinted a few times that I had something special in mind for my dining area- and this was it!

I am also into bento making for my girl . This is not an easy task but I try my best to learn from blogs and books. I hope I can sustain this 'bentoing' but for how long I have no idea....cos I have to wake up as early as 5am then rush everything by 630am and to leave home by 645am.....rushing like mad right? But when my girl and boy told me that they love the food I prepared for them...I think its just worth it =)

People today wrongly pray for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit as they say the disciples did in the upper room. But I tell you the disciples were not praying for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. They knew what was expected of them and I am sure they were seeking wisdom as to how to go about replacing Judas and preparing themselves for the great ministry that had been given to them.

The Woman in the Window
I had never seen so many hippies in one place outside Central Park. We were all over the grounds and buildings, setting up tents and campsites outdoors and inside, utilizing the communal kitchen, and playing together everywhere. Perhaps what amazed me most during that week was how careful we were to keep the place clean, how nothing was trashed or damaged, how all of us were committed to leaving the grounds as we'd found them or even better.
So when Atlanta's premier Master of the Dead calls to ask for help with a vampire on the loose, Kate leaps at the chance of some paying work. Turns out this is not an isolated incident, and Kate needs to get to the bottom of it-fast, or the city and everyone dear to her might pay the ultimate price.

I followed my parent's home, even though they weren't aware of my presense. My mom wept all the way while my dad remained silent. He begged my mom to calm down but it all fell on deaf ears. We got home to find the house filled with friends and relatives, my Dad carried my body and laid it on the mat in the living room. Prayers for forgiveness were said, and my parents were advised to stop crying as it wouldn't bring me back. I watched my Mom cry and weep all night as she asked God why He Had to take my life.
The mean average is where a random variable is most likely to land. The further you stray from the mean, the less likely you are to find something landing that far out. So, any kid who scored highly is much more likely to come closer to the 25% mean average next time.

I don't know what more to say. I have a lot of projects in my head. I want to start working with new design, modelling, etc. computer programs and improve skills with the old ones. I want to write more technology related stuff. I want to make clothes and start doing accessories. I want to improve my make up skills and make tutorials to help others. I want to live more useful life and write about it.
Now, I don't want to sound like I'm crapping on the whole movie, because I actually did enjoy it. I think they did some perfect casting with Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades. They are two of my favorite actors, and I can't think of any two people more perfect for those two roles. I also have a huge crush on the ruggedly handsome Sam Worthington, and Mads Mikkelson is pretty much great in everything he does, and this is no exception. My favorite part of the movie was the whole Medusa scene. From Io explaining the Medusa backstory to Perseus cutting off her head, it is amazing! Its nuts because they all survive these giant ass scorpions, and the three witches (also a cool scene.."a sacrifice!"), but they all drop like flies when it comes to Medusa. She doesn't even have to do anything. She looks at you...you die. End of story.

Making dumplings is a great way to get over that after-work slump of forgoing the dinner plans and diving into a bag of microwave popcorn (I fully admit to having done this), because even though it takes awhile, it's pretty easy, and I felt like a kid in science class watching an experiment! These two dough logs blow up and get all slimy in a big pot of boiling water. Don't worry, the slime subsides by the time they're ready to eat :)

Honeybees, like ants and termites, are considered super-organisms. This means that although the colony is made up of many individuals, none of the individuals can survive without the comradery of one another. The queen, workers and drones each have their job, and each job is essential for the survival of the colony. The swarm of bees occurs for many reasons, not enough space is the most common reason, and when it does happen, it is the equivalent of a colony of bees giving birth to another colony. Leaving the hive in this swarm is the mother of the bees from the initial hive, some her loyal workers, and some drones in a massive, incredible, engagingly powerful performance. They leave the 'parent hive' looking for new nesting grounds, and in the parent hive they just left, grows a new queen, hatching out young sister bees eager to usher her in to the culture of the hive and ensure her safety in her mating flight and new role as new mother of the colony. All of this is done through the true interdependence, constant plebiscites, and instantaneous communication of the colony.. lol.. much like our society works right? Well, in a community with the Hive Mentality it does!

Here it is. The real purpose of the visit to Pho 68. Pho with rare beef and braised beef. It looked the part, and tasted it too. They've got the makings of a really good pho here. The stock was excellent. Deep, aromatic and intensely savoury. Wafer thin slices of beef were rare on arrival but cooked through as time progressed, the gentle poaching keeping them tender. The braised beef (brisket I think) was also sliced thin, but had a stronger, minerally flavour. The tendon running through it was soft and gelatinous speaking of long, slow cooking. The noodles, save for a little gluey clump at the top, were cooked just right.
Down on the bay shore, Henry Yesler had been operating his sawmill since about two years ago. He had shut the machine off for the day, for this was a day like no other. He would soon join a few others of his American associates, to sign a treaty with the natives whose ancient lands were all around. Chief Seattle would arrive to represent the Duwamish and Salish peoples; he was known among the new settlers as a reasonable man, a leader who understood the tectonics of this moment's history.

For this also there is no technological or large-scale solution. Perhaps, as they believe, the most conscientiously up-to-date people can easily do without local workshops and stores, local journalism, a local newspaper, a local post office, all of which supposedly have been replaced by technologies. But what technology can replace personal privacy or the coherence of a family or a community? What technology can undo the collateral damages of an inhuman rate of technological change?

A few years ago I discovered 'osteopathic manipulative treatment' (OMT) and the pain in my knee mysteriously disappeared. But by then I was fully in the throes of motherhood and exercise had been off the table for so long that I didn't know how to get it back into my life. I still don't really know how I will accomplish this task, I just know that I must. I need an exercise montage. I need abdominal muscles.

Our personal psychology is how our karmic patterns show up in this lifetime. A general Buddhist or Hindu perspective on karma suggests that the individual soul moves through consciousness lifetime after lifetime, incarnating again and again in the school of life in order to complete various tasks and lessons, and to release contractions of consciousness.

But as our journey began to unfold, God laid it on our hearts to be open to adopt children that others have looked over.

And for those who are still walking the elephant to the door, here is what we discovered;
Alan was born in the Auvergnat town of Riom. His father Georges (Jord in Breton) Cochevelou was a civil servant in the French Ministry of Finance who achieved his dream of recreating a Celtic or Breton harp in the small town of Gourin, Brittany. In 1953, Alan began playing the instrument at the age of nine under the tutelage of his father and Denise Megevand, a concert harpist. Alan also learned Celtic mythology, art and history as well as the Breton language, traditional Breton dance and the Scottish bagpipe and the bombarde, a traditional Breton instrument, from the oboe family. Alan began playing concerts at eleven years and studying traditional Breton, English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh folk music, also learning the drum, Irish flute, and tin whistle. He competed in and won several Breton traditional music competitions in the Bleimor Pipe band. Alan spent his childhood in Paris, with its cosmopolitan influences from France, Algeria, Morocco and elsewhere. But he fell in love with Breton music and Celtic culture in general, and often went back in his teens to Brittany.

This post wants to highlight the challenges, that come along with the recent phenomenon of Chinese tourists, as well as discuss Taiwan's current struggles as a travel destination and travel nation. Taiwan is truly a big step ahead of China, when it comes to travel etiquette and service, however, there is still room for improvement. I believe, that we need to give Chinese tourists some time, they will make mistakes and we need to firmly point them out, but they will also learn and improve through time - some more, some less. I'm interested to hear what you say! Here are some of my questions:

He also pointed out that Nazri had yet to look into allegations that the Attorney-General's Chambers had dropped its RM40 million corruption case against former Malacca Chief Minister Tan Sri Abdul Rahim Thamby Chik in exchange for him stepping down from all government and party positions.
Thank you to anyone who nominated me, or put me on that shortlist. It's an astonishing list of gifted people, and I'm very proud and startled to be on it.
This is a little tablerunner that is for an upcoming workshop. Wool, rick rack, cotton and appliqué . . .
On days that I need to complete a lot I will set my timer for 15 minutes and work on one task for the full 15 minutes. I will stop that task when the timer goes off and move on to another task. This usually happens on good days, where the pain is tolerable. I will work on one task, for example, clearing clutter in one room, then I move to 15 minutes doing computer work, then 15 minutes cleaning a focus zone, then 15 minutes reading. I try to alternate from something physical to something sedentary, and including a 15 minute "break" every third 15 minute session. This is what I call my 15 minute day, and I find that I am most productive these days.
When one adds to this the fact that the arts are not only an economic multiplier, but also a social and cultural multiplier in an economy in which jobs are becoming even less and less interesting, it can make more sense to implement arts support schemes than it does in periods when the work ethic seems to be operating at its full volume.
Having the kids be photosensitive is an interesting twist and really made for some cool, inventive visual touchstones - like how Grace has to close all the windows and doors to make sure the sun doesn't creep in accidentally. One scene in the beginning shows this quite well - after telling Anne to leave the room to study by herself, Grace has to first tell Bertha to close the windows in the adjoining room to keep her daughter safe. This plot point wasn't entirely necessary to move the story forward, but the fact that it is there adds another layer of complexity and weight to the plot, upping the ante on the danger present in a very peculiar and unique way. The fog constantly surrounding the house is great, too, always looking ominous and ghostly, setting the stage with a real atmosphere.

Come Saturday, no matter what, I WILL be back in the craft room making a card .... any card ... even a one-layer-card. It may take extra effort to find all the needed supplies since everything is just tossed willy-nilly in there, but I refuse to go another weekend without crafting in my own space. So that will be my end goal for this week: make one card in remodeled craft room. How hard that that be? Really? LOL LOL

Schirmbeck on Wednesday filed a formal complaint over the matter with Galveston County District Attorney Jack Roady. He also asked for an investigation into whether the city's use of public funds on pro-camera advertising on the public access television channel 16 and on the city's website violates state election law. In November, residents will have a chance to vote on whether to continue the photo ticketing program. Schirmbeck believes the slick video material was produced by Redflex, but the commercials did not disclose their true origin, in violation of state campaign laws.

The only sad point to this is when logic kicks in and tells me that at some point this beach will become normal. I can understand the eastern philosophy which says that some things are only meant to be viewed for a moment so that the effect of it lasts a lifetime.
It pours with a huge frothing head that does recesses pretty quickly as well as leave a pretty decent lace on the glass. On the aroma side of things it has a malty wheatiness to it that is a nice slightly spicy crisp refreshing smell.
I was pleasantly surprised to find the quality of items such as fruits and meat to be just what I would have picked. The bananas aren't too ripe and the clementines look fine. I got everything on my order and there were no surprises, since the website offers 3-D close ups of all things you buy, so I knew which brands and how much of everything I was getting.

Charlene M. Proctor: When we bring more light into the body, there is a corresponding emotional and biological reaction. Old barriers, physical blocks, and emotional patterns come to the surface in order to be released. The dark night of the soul represents a cleansing of the personal unconscious in preparation for a deeper descent of light, and is usually considered as a prerequisite for the deeper stages of spiritual mastery.
Inspired by the TED talk that Graham Hill gave about becoming a weekday vegetarian, I too am going to aspire for that. I want to make sure that i am able to uphold my agreement so my aim to eat vegetarian for 4 out of the 7 days of the week. So I will have the weekends to enjoy meat, and one day of the week if i am especially feeling like i need to have a nice burger or something. This effects so many parts of the global environment that it is something that a lot of people need to consider. It will help with energy use, preserving land, animal rights, cut back on unhealthy foods and water pollution.
Nursing-sadly no. Mama dried up and Jonah wasn't getting nearly enough so we weaned. It was sad but then it was freeing for me. I was either pregnant or nursing for over three years! That's a long time so I was kinda happy to have my body back although I would have nursed longer, as long as he wanted if it had been possible.
It is relatively obvious that certain international business pursuits are more likely to influence environmental conditions. These types of businesses need to be especially concerned about the fashion in which they conduct business. They must assure citizens that the environment will not be tarnished for decades to come. I have no qualms about them facilitating business in an international setting, but they need to make sure that the environment doesn't become degraded as a result of their organizational operations.

Tophatter has had a few glitches with their software...the missed alert for my customer being one of them. The other one was their server crashed on Saturday night in the middle of the weekend bazaar auction mostly due to the number of auction attendees in the room, I think. It took them about 20 minutes to reset everything and they were back in business. The staff have been very attentive to their customers...buyers and sellers alike.

Tennessee invoked the rule for the 1975 season, during the time when the maximum number of scheduled games was eleven. That season, the Vols traveled to Honolulu for their 12th scheduled game, winning 28-6. There were four non-conference games at home on the schedule that season - Maryland, North Texas State, Colorado State, and Utah - with a fifth on the road (UCLA). I don't know which of those four home NC games was the extra one added due to the Hawaii game. I hope it wasn't North Texas State - the worst Volunteer loss I personally ever witnessed.

People today wrongly pray for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit as they say the disciples did in the upper room. But I tell you the disciples were not praying for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. They knew what was expected of them and I am sure they were seeking wisdom as to how to go about replacing Judas and preparing themselves for the great ministry that had been given to them.

Yesterday I did pretty well in the food dept. My usual bagel and cream cheese for breakfast (though I really do need to go get my weight watchers bagels instead of the big white ones I have now), honeydew and cantaloupe for lunch, a small wrap with about 1/8 cup chicken and the rest peppers and onions for supper and some more honeydew for a bedtime snack. Normally I wouldn't have a bedtime snack cause I tend to just mindlessly eat, but this was a planned snack with a set portion and I didn't even want to mindlessly eat afterwards!
When Prime Minister John Major reflected on his country, he was subjected to ridicule, but what he said resonated with the majority of English people, the main exception being the liberal/leftists whose central role in life appears to be the destruction of all that we hold dear.

I have been busy making invitations for a Birthday Lunch for my Dad who will be 80 in November.
Billy slowly drove into Casey's driveway, and although she had been through a night of fear and terror, she felt nothing other than happiness and joy when she saw her house. It looked like heaven to Casey because she wasn't even sure if she would live to see daylight. Casey slung open the truck door and jumped out of Billy's truck in lightening speed. As she ran up to the driver's side and softly said "I know exactly what happened last night, Billy. You guys drugged me and raped me. And I will never forget it. You're going to get away with it because I am too ashamed to tell anyone what you guys did to me. You can bet your ass that God will avenge my honor. You may not go to jail, but you will suffer for what you did to me." Billy looked at her, and he was completely stunned that she remembered what had happened. This is probably due to, the fact that they gave her what they thought was a drug that would make her forget. Evidently, the effects weren't as potent as Billy had hoped.
Fuck cellphones. How the fuck do we think we're ever going to stay on this planet if we keep pumping so much shit into cellphones. You know what they're doing, right? They're making it so our entire life can be carried on one tiny fucking handheld thing. Imagine that. A monopoly on life itself. I'm waiting for the day when cellphones actually spew out Starbucks coffee. It'll happen. It'll fuckin' HAPPEN. You'd figure with all these amazing additions to portable communication, they'd actually make a phone that could fuckin' work as a PHONE!

We join together in meditation and prayer this morning seeking to realize that the fabric of our lives is woven by our own hands, every thought, every word, every action is a thread in the social tapestry. So as we weave let us always be mindful that each and every thread is a contribution, our contribution, to the whole. Amen.

My memoir on adopting my daughter from China was perhaps the hardest thing I ever wrote mainly because at the same time that I was trying to understand what was going on, what this sudden unexpected journey in the middle of my life actually meant, to capture in words what it actually felt like- I was trying to get others to understand, to feel all of this at the same time.
So it's time to celebrate! Throw confetti! Roll your eyes, because now I won't stop talking about my book. I'm so excited to be working with a publishing company with so much talent and ambition up their sleeves.

Do you know what I've chosen for us to do? You guessed it if you said, "an applique' quilt"! I'll save that whole story for another day, but for now, I want to tell you about an idea that our friend, Flo shared during our coffee group.

My mom found a pair of these adorable tree trunk side tables at Goodwill for $15. They had weird rectangular black glass tops and the tables themselves were all chipped up.
And so I began. I used the instructions I found online as my chief guide but after three days I was a little skeptical that the sour dough had fermented enough or produced enough yeast. My Twitter friend Finn said that he had been feeding his starter ("Veruca") for 12 days and it was now time. So I asked him if he thought my starter was ready? He confirmed what I thought and said no. So I've been letting "Finn Jr". grow and grow. Last night he became a rebellious teenager and we woke up to him trying to escape the safety of his jar to explore the world (thus the picture above this posting).

I'm stealing a line from a song title today-the famous "Rainy Days and Mondays" by The Carpenters, 1971. Can't you just hear the tune in your head now? If you can, then I can assure you that it's probably going to be playing in there a long time! Or at least that's what happens to me when I am reminded of a song I like-the lyrics and music dance in my brain for hours at a time before fading away, often to appear again when I am trying to fall asleep in the middle of the night. Curses! My brother calls this phenomena 'ear worms'.an image I actually don't even like to think about!
"African economies easily rank among the most resilient in the world.

Although Chary ended up getting sick early Sunday morning I would have to say the trip was very enjoyable for everyone. I surely don't get to see Grandiose, Frisuer, and Chary nearly enough so I greatly cherish the opportunities I do get with them. I am very hopeful that Grandiose is able to make a trip up for a regular season game when the tailgating is in full force along with all of the great traditions that take place before each and every home game at Notre Dame. I am sure Frisuer and Chary will remember the experience as well. I hope to do this again next year as well, but we will have to see if we are able to make it work out again for everyone.

The support actors, in particular Shreyas Talpade and Arjun Rampal are well cast in their roles. Being a Farah Khan film, of course the songs are exceptionally well choreographed and filmed. One of the things we appreciate Farah for is her determination that her leading men should be objectified as much as, if not a little more than, the glamorous heroines. She outdoes herself with Dard-e-Disco which has hilariously bad lyrics (apparently she kept telling Javed Akhtar to make his lyrics worse) and is full of gratuitous shots of SRK in, emerging from, and being doused with, water.
Even the souls who are paid to do this are still souls and are still behind their surface experiencing ascension, just as every soul on Gaia's surface in each and every form that such souls take, currently are.

I first saw this H&M snake-embossed envelope clutch weeks ago at a location in the city, fell in love (who would've thought since I hate snakes?!), but passed because I didn't have my 20% coupon with me. Days later, when I was ready to actually buy, I couldn't find it anywhere in the stores near me. This is what I get for wanting to save $4 lol. I was about to give up when I recently revisited one of the stores and saw they had restocked. Hallelujah!

Having just been exposed to tombs, mummies and the world of Hatshepsut full-throttle in a middle school text book, it seemed more fitting than ever to face the crowds and potential chaos with three kids ages 6 - 11, all in the name of seeing the real thing. And, with no more strollers or diapers to consider, it was well worth the attempt.
At the wheel of Falken Tire's Porsche 911 GT3 RSR, the winning car at Mid-Ohio and Baltimore, Bryan Sellers (USA) posted the ninth quickest time. He contests the race with Porsche factory pilot Wolf Henzler (Germany). "We didn't have an optimal set-up today, but we know that our car and the tyres will perform much better in the race than in the qualifying," explained Bryan Sellers. Wolf Henzler added: "The circuit was very cold over the last days. Today we have sun and the asphalt temperatures were suddenly much higher. That changed everything. Our team still simply lacks the experience of reacting to such changes in a short timeframe."
If I had a majority of 29 seats in Parliament and me and my ministers were actually "Serving the People", I'd have nothing to worry about..I wouldn't need to hold 3 public meetings in one week, deploy hundreds of people on websites and generally look like I've been caught with my underwear around my ankles!

And by the laughter, I surmise that she could tell without me letting her in on the secret. Apparently, besides my accent deepening into obscurity, I raised my voice several decibels and reverted to my Ghanenglish grammar peppered with Dagbani, something that is significantly different from the speech my Canadian-raised family is used to. And now I'm laughing and blushing, and internally cringing because I feel proud to retain vestiges of my Ghanaian communication skills, but wondering how to balance this maintenance of my slightly shifted identity while re-learning how to connect with Canadians. Especially because I need to sound polished and professional at my upcoming interviews for medicine.
I am also into bento making for my girl . This is not an easy task but I try my best to learn from blogs and books. I hope I can sustain this 'bentoing' but for how long I have no idea....cos I have to wake up as early as 5am then rush everything by 630am and to leave home by 645am.....rushing like mad right? But when my girl and boy told me that they love the food I prepared for them...I think its just worth it =)
For the stock: add all ingredients to a soup pot. Pick off all the chicken that you want to eat. Put everything else in the pot. Cook about 35 to 45 minutes. Remove chicken bones, skin, etc. from pot. Remove and discard bay leaves and anything else. You should have approximately 3 quarts of stock. (Again, if you just buy chicken stock you can skip this whole apart)
It was a grade ten class (or the tenth grade as they say down south, a form which always causes me to imagine the voice of James Earl Jones), mostly constituted with boys. Although teenage males can be (ahem - pun warning) boysterous, it was a pretty good class. It was a group that could easily have gotten out of hand, but somehow, we found a way to co-exist, and it actually turned out to be quite a good class.

Not everyone is a fan of Valentine's Day, and although I'm one of those as well, I just want to be clear that unlike my last book, Fractured Facade, this short story is not about me. Well, some "elements" of the tale are based on true life experiences, but not necessarily mine.
I really wanted to give the quilter the ability to use their stash but also allow them to go shopping. Who wouldn't want to have some of the newest cutest fabrics in their scrap quilt? It was VERY HARD for me to STOP buying fabric. I kept telling myself, "Ooooh! Wouldn't this be cute? I have to have a bit of this!" I actually used over 150+ fabrics in this quilt. I hope you have fun playing with your stash and adding the newest cutest fabrics to your quilt.
It took all morning but we finally convinced Tali that she was two. She kept saying, "No!" but that her response to everything these days. ;) She didn't want to blow out the candles because she just wanted to dig into the cherry tomatoes. Those were the favorites and the first to disappear. Tali also ate the apples and sampled the cucumbers. Ana ate tomatoes, oranges, apples, cucumbers, and celery. She sampled the peppers. Amanda ate everything after arranging it all neatly on her plate. We didn't get to the pineapple so we'll try that at snack time.

If you buy into the idea of an economic collapse that allows some sort of plausible, individualistic retreat scenario, you are probably also going to like Crawford's EMP scenarios, even if the most obvious EMP scenarios would normally include enough regular style nukes to melt the planet.

The internet and books. Here is a way that could be considered "teaching yourself." Looking up things you're interested in on the net, reading books on the subject... Yet even that isn't necessarily an all-by-yourself thing. Sometimes someone will read something out loud to me that they think I might be interested in. I regularly share article links and in turn have people send me links. I interact with people and learn from them on the internet quite often. I visit the library or a second-hand bookstore with family and friends, and we share the interesting books we find.

Singer Dionne Warwick showed that the way to San Jose isn't the only thing she's not familiar with, as she pawed in bewilderment at the cash register. Actress and deaf person Marlee Matlin conveniently forgot a lifetime of lip-reading so she could have a sign-language interpreter serve as a go-between in case anyone was tempted to yell at her. Supermodel Niki Taylor tossed pizza dough into the air, actually catching it on the way down a few times.
One of the things that I am really enjoying about this light is how it casts upwards. It really makes the room feel larger and I love the warm light from the bulbs (our dimmer switch that we installed a while ago also really helps). This is what it looks like right now as I type this blog up.

It isn't a hiding place. It is a finding place.
You know how sometimes you just feel grouchy as all get-out? For no reason? Sure, if you're female and somewhere between puberty and the end of menopause, you can blame it on hormones. Actually, you can blame it on hormones at any time--even if you're a guy. "It's andropause! I swear! I didn't mean to shoot your truck!"
Except about 20 minutes later I get a call from a strange number.
Having a good reputation is something you want in the music business. It sounds like obvious good advice for artists to tell them to be able to play well with others, but this also needs to include others you might not like or want to play with. In todays music business, you may come across and have to work with people you don't like, they might be doing things you cant stand, but bashing them excessively online or around others is not going to help you get what you want in the end.

I knew almost nothing about either, so it was a big adventure each week to go to the university's excellent music-school library and rummage through the record bins.
I think, more often than not, we try to play God and work through our own problems instead of depending on Him to help us through. And this is where the book In the Eye of the Storm comes into play.

Now that a few days have passed, I look back on that Chrysalis weekend with such joy. I don't think about the logistics of it all, I think about how present God was throughout it. With God's help, that weekend was flawless. And as I sat on Sunday listening to these girls talk about how positively affected they were by this weekend.. I knew at that very instant that every bit of sweat and tears was worth it.

Schirmbeck on Wednesday filed a formal complaint over the matter with Galveston County District Attorney Jack Roady. He also asked for an investigation into whether the city's use of public funds on pro-camera advertising on the public access television channel 16 and on the city's website violates state election law. In November, residents will have a chance to vote on whether to continue the photo ticketing program. Schirmbeck believes the slick video material was produced by Redflex, but the commercials did not disclose their true origin, in violation of state campaign laws.
So end our readers' tributes to Hitch. As I expect many of you have been doing, I've spent quite a few hours over the last two weeks watching videos of Christopher in debate, giving talks, or taking down pompous talking heads on television. I could recommend my favorites, but suggest instead that you just find a random one and follow the YouTube links. You will be impressed: for someone who talked so often, he rarely repeated himself, and everything he said sounded fresh. We have nobody to replace this man, but, thank Ceiling Cat, he left us a legacy of not only his writings and the example of his courage, but also the visual record of his eloquence and incessant fight for the truth.

I've been dating a little bit, and its been fun. Both men and women. There is one very pretty grrrrr in Ellensburg but it seems like we are both gravitating in different directions. I've found someone that I think I really like, and I'm a little surprised because it is not someone that would ever catch my eye...I mean, the kind of person that you go by in the grocery store and don't even notice. But once you make yourself look, well, his heart is like a kaleidoscope of radiant gems and syrups. My own juices are flowing with the bright heat of summer, and love is floating with the fuzzy cotton tree seeds in the wind.

In five stories, Christie allows the murderer to escape justice (and in the case of the last three, implicitly almost approves of their crimes); these are The Witness for the Prosecution, The Man in the Brown Suit, Murder on the Orient Express, Curtain and The Unexpected Guest. (When Christie adapted Witness into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed.) There are also numerous instances where the killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but instead dies (death usually being presented as a more 'sympathetic' outcome), for example Peril at End House, Death on the Nile, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Crooked House, Appointment with Death, The Hollow, and Secret Adversary. In some cases this is with the collusion of the detective involved. Five Little Pigs, and arguably Ordeal by Innocence, end with the question of whether formal justice will be done unresolved.

Not only did I rework that original block, but I have since done more applique' work (that Scrappy Dresden Plate quilt I'm working on requires applique', as do the monthly minis for Sandy's monthly QAL) and now in charge of the design for our next guild Opportunity (raffle) Quilt for 2014. Do you know what I've chosen for us to do? You guessed it if you said, "an applique' quilt"! I'll save that whole story for another day, but for now, I want to tell you about an idea that our friend, Flo shared during our coffee group.

I'm sitting here at 10am in a condo that is much more empty than it was 12 hours ago. My tv is gone, my coffee table is gone, and most importantly the boxes of my exes stuff that i had hidden behind the couch for the past 5 months is gone. I didn't know how it would go today. My last relationship was a tricky one. I'd have to say it was honestly the worst and most dysfunctional relationship I've ever had in my entire life (i've had a total of 3 boyfriends).

The only catch? On Passover, we're not allowed to eat bread. This has to do with the part of the Passover story where the Jews wander the desert, and are unable to make leavened bread. By not eating bread for seven days, we pay tribute to what our ancestors had to suffer during their exodus.

Then finally, they put me on depakote. I am mentioning this drug by name because I have heard from several other women that they believe depakote was the cause of this for them too, and a doctor at a California University said that he strongly, strongly believes that it gives PCOS to young women. Then I heard that some doctors have been instructed not to prescribe it to women under 40. Depakote won't own up to that and they knowingly let the doctors prescribe it (at least, until recently from what I hear). I don't want to get into who my sources are because I don't want to get anyone in trouble. It's very good for seizures, my brother had to take it for years and it kept him alive, but for Bipolar- not so much.
And in the meantime, since I can't build a Time Machine and go back to school and get a different degree, I spend some of my time trying to get as much education as I can on subjects about communication and language as I try to understand why my son has such a problem with his.

But now let's get back to the fish at the top of this post. I didn't really make any resolutions per se this year, but I did decide I should try to cook and eat more fish. So good for you! So tasty! So many different fish to try!

Thus, no doubt soon you will probly hear soon some business leaders or pretend potential self-appointed communist leaders lamenting the lack of organization of the #Occupy movements, describing them as "in choate" (which is a kind of wide penis with no head), or "udderless," or "lacking discernible goals" (like Sporting Gijon). What they are really mean is that there is a ferment of new ideas that therefore could be dangerous and must be curtailed, or at least curtopped. After all, nobody has any idea where a march that goes nowhere might end up. If these peoples weren't too feckless to emigrate we could at least lure them onto a ferry with the promise of jobs in Australia and transport them there. We would never hear of them ever again! But while they are there, in the midst of ordinary, heads-down, knees-back God-fearing punters, fermenting theories without limitations and trying out new processes, such as democracy-never a positive development-they constitute a threat to our docile, passive, obedient way of life. They must be stomped on by square-headed baton-wielding riot police, preferably from up the country, before any new ideas seep out into the public body at large, like a ball of ideological pus.

It cost far more than any other blazer I own, but it was worth it!
Once you have your paper cut out in the size you want, I generally use my Xacto knife to score my folds (very gently, I really don't even push, just drag the blade gently across the paper). I score the "pretty side" of my paper, not the back. A ruler helps to keep your lines straight, if you don't trust yourself scoring the paper, you can also line up your ruler and fold against it to keep your folds crisp.
If more people participate in events like this, there is a greater chance that laws will be passed to combat the issue.

I also feel a change coming in me. I prefer to stay at home, or go for a quiet dinner, or watch a movie. I don't like clubbing anymore, or going and getting "wasted" which is what most of my friends do. Nothing wrong with that at all. But I am just not there anymore. My idea of a good night out now is relaxing at home with a good movie, or going to a cinema, or cooking dinner, or going out to eat. If alcohol must be involved, a nice quiet bar where we can sit and talk.

Jupiter owns Pisces, and the Moon owns Cancer. This is another reason why Cancer is an even better place for Jupiter than Pisces. Huh? That sounds backwards? No, there is a very important lesson to learn here! You may be as great as a planet, but you never achieve your zenith of potential except in partnership with other people. It is in cooperation with the energies of other people that we can rise to greater heights than we can on our own. And this is yet another factor making Cancer, not Pisces, the exaltation sign of Jupiter.
When I was in Phnom Penh recently, I discovered in the guidebook that there was a cafe called the "Lazy Gecko Cafe". I looked it up on the map and saw that it was quite far from where I was staying and also from most of the areas I would be visiting. However, the pull to seek out this lazy gecko was strong and on my final day, I decided to hunt it down and sink a coffee or two.

Let me tell you, I previously loved Gerard Butler's Phantom but Ramin Karimloo's Phantom made me want to hop through my television set, kick Christine out of the picture and run away with him on the streets of Paris. He was AMAZING with a gorgeous voice and so much raw, sexy emotion. Despite kicking her to the side for the Phantom the gorgeous Sierra Boggess was an awesome Christine with an amazingly hypnotic voice. The height of the play where they sang the theme song was filled with such romance and emotion. I also fell in love with the Music of the Night from Ramin's emotionally raw and sexy voice. I had to grab the soundtrack after to relive the experience over and over again. I simply fell in love with the production!

Then the other image started to haunt me, that of strangers finding the envelope and depositing the check into their personal bank accounts.

But why are there so few older women in television anyway? I considered the roles for women over 35 in shows that I watch. You'll have to pardon my lack of reality television knowledge, so feel free to fill me in on older women in any of those shows. Also, I am aware that these are all dramas.

Her bruised breasts and body bounce painfully in opposite directions, the soles of her feet slapping noisily against the darkened floor.

A sense of dread and foreboding fill her, and she dares to look over her shoulder, only to find her unhappy attendants chasing after her desperately.

You are transformed into a world where rolling hills, sprawling vineyards, beautiful houses, and quaint villages take over. From lunch with a traditional Italian family to cooking pasta, visiting shops selling ham, cured meats and cheese, tasting wines and visiting a local factory making pasta, Antonio and Gennaro keeps you entertained with their wit and humour in Bologna- their first stop. Next they move on to the South of Italy to the Amalfi coast, where Gennaro grew up. Personally this was the most favourite episode for me. Cooking by the sea side, plucking fresh lemons off the trees and biting into them, preparing a linguine dish on a boat using fresh octopus and mussels which Gennaro collected after his diving expedition and the wit and humour the two Italians share among themselves were absolutely fun to watch. Ah! the ricotta and lemon tart they made in this episode still holds fresh in my memory. Its high up there on my to-make list.

Then finally, they put me on depakote. I am mentioning this drug by name because I have heard from several other women that they believe depakote was the cause of this for them too, and a doctor at a California University said that he strongly, strongly believes that it gives PCOS to young women. Then I heard that some doctors have been instructed not to prescribe it to women under 40. Depakote won't own up to that and they knowingly let the doctors prescribe it (at least, until recently from what I hear). I don't want to get into who my sources are because I don't want to get anyone in trouble. It's very good for seizures, my brother had to take it for years and it kept him alive, but for Bipolar- not so much.

A short story scenario is given, then the child rides his or her horse, "Shadow," across deserts, mountains, and so on. Math problems appear at the bottom of the screen. As the problem is answered, the horse jumps over an obstacle. If the problem is missed, the horse stops while the game gives the correct answer. The problems and speed are adjusted to the child's abilities, with problems the child has trouble with generated more frequently.

Charming landscaping. Flanked by a community mosque on one side and the Karachi residence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi on the other, Hilal Park stretches over a hillock. The landscape design, which makes exceptional use of the topography, is the highlight of the Park. A brick path, edged with immaculately pruned topiaries weaves through well-maintained, exotically shaped flower beds, up a hill, and over culverts and wooden bridges that span over the narrow ravines in the rock formations.
Biologists generally agree, however that one feature above all others defines the orchid and differentiates it from virtually all other flowering plants - the fusion of the male portion of the flower (stamens) and the female portion (pistils). Orchid flowers are pollinated by a great variety of flying animals, and their diversity in floral structure has resulted from adaptations to various pollinators. About half the orchid species are pollinated by bees; moths, butterflies, flies, birds, and other agents pollinate the rest. Many orchid flowers are adapted for pollination by a single species of insect.

You do not win public backing for an argument about pensions by inconveniencing your parents.
Schirmbeck on Wednesday filed a formal complaint over the matter with Galveston County District Attorney Jack Roady. He also asked for an investigation into whether the city's use of public funds on pro-camera advertising on the public access television channel 16 and on the city's website violates state election law. In November, residents will have a chance to vote on whether to continue the photo ticketing program. Schirmbeck believes the slick video material was produced by Redflex, but the commercials did not disclose their true origin, in violation of state campaign laws.

This studio is now gone, and nobody will ever record in it again. It was Sandro's house for a long time. Over ten years I believe. And he was always paying rent, and, after he turned it into a studio, the owner would not sell the house to him without trying to rip him off. Now it is part of a history that involved a lot of people, a lot of music, a lot of concentration and dedication - a history that has moved into other places and other songs, that can't be stopped but which remains alive thanks to recording and sharing technologies.

Most crock pot recipes are simple "dump and cover" recipes. This one is a little different. It requires chopping and browning and lots of ingredients. While this sauce is not the typical, no-fuss, crock pot recipe the result is SO worth it! It's my new favorite spaghetti/pasta sauce recipe.

For me it didn't get bad until after the D&C. I suppose I assumed that it would be the same this time. But then I have to remind myself that it was almost as if I had 3 weeks to deal with the shock of it all before I actually "lost" my baby. This time I knew that I couldn't deal with the emotional turmoil associated with waiting for things to happen naturally as my body obviously has a very difficult time letting go. I gave myself one day to let in soak in, to say goodbye to my sweet child, and then took Cytotec again (which this time didn't even make me bleed at all) and had the D&C on Thursday.

The guru, or acaryadeva, as we learn from the bona fide scriptures, delivers the message of the absolute world, the transcendental abode of the Absolute Personality, where everything nondifferentially serves the Absolute Truth. We have heard so many times: mahajano yena gata sa pantha ("Traverse the trail which your previous acarya has passed"), but we have hardly tried to understand the real purport of this sloka. If we scrutinizingly study this proposition, we understand that the mahajana is one, and the royal road to the transcendental world is also one. In the Muaka Upaniad (1.2.12) it is said:

It's been a while - since December, in fact - since I pulled out the brew equipment. Well, with the return of summer, and my recently purchased, though not yet assembled MLT, the time has come to make some beer. Now, the little Brew Devil inside of me is pulling me in a few different ways, and I have a couple of obligations to previously conjured brews, so the brew schedule is filling up fast. Here's a quick run down.
What I have not found is any evidence that the motive for farm murders is "genocide". The perpetrators are sometimes caught, tried and convicted. In how many of these cases has the motive been proved to be "genocide"? If the genocide propagandists can show that this morive has been proved in the majority of cases (a 51% majority will do), then I will be prepared to take their contentions seriously. But until they do that, I will take their assertions with several bags of salt, and merely white racist propaganda. Sannie sê Sannie sal sewe sakke sout sleep.

It reminds me of the first day he started primary school (but so much worse). He was well adjusted, happy, so ready and all smiles. I was all smiles on the outside also but came home and sobbed a million tears. A time of change and also no other littlies at home to focus on as had been my hope and dream.
Almost the exact middle, actually. Young and school-trained London singer Woon's debut album, Mirrorwriting, sits between Katy B and James B, pop theatricality and singer-songwriter calm, club culture and bedroom indie, old-school soul and modern electronic R&B, extroverted and introverted. And tying it all together is the language of UK bass. His first major single, 2010's justly lauded "Night Air", announced him as one of a number of young English artists for whom garage, and everything that came after, was just another bit of pop language to use. And from the slow-motion jungle syncopations and muted bass blare of "Street" to the stuttering retro-rave breakbeats that drive "Spirits", the computer-assisted Woon makes sorta-pop from the last 20 years of UK dance the way current U.S. guitar kids draw from surf-rock and girl-groups.
First of all, for those who don't know I have 3 adopted siblings. They are all from the Philippines. Actually there are six kids in my family and our order goes a bit like this - biological, adopted, biological, adopted, biological, adopted. :) My parents were also foster parents for about 8 years, so we had infants in and out of our house - most in which (I think) were adopted. So as you can tell adoption has been a pretty big part of my life. I always knew I wanted to adopt. It just seemed like something I was suppose to do when having a family. My husband's family is a bit different from mine - he's the only one! Although we came from different types of families, we both knew we wanted to have a family eventually.

Scientists at Rothamsted are trialling a variety of GM wheat that produces a pheromone that aphids don't like. Aphids eat wheat, and reduce crop yields. If you can stop them from going near the wheat, then the yields should be higher. As a pre-emptive strike, I'm going to point out that the gene added to the wheat occurs naturally in many species of plant. It is not, as has been said, a 'cow gene'.

For this also there is no technological or large-scale solution. Perhaps, as they believe, the most conscientiously up-to-date people can easily do without local workshops and stores, local journalism, a local newspaper, a local post office, all of which supposedly have been replaced by technologies. But what technology can replace personal privacy or the coherence of a family or a community? What technology can undo the collateral damages of an inhuman rate of technological change?

But this movie is not made for people like me. It is made for a different demographic, which is fine. I knew it going in, but I had heard enough to suggest it would have, like, cross-subcultural appeal. It did not. I would almost rather watch a regular romcom/dramedy or whatever this was because at least it isn't trying to pretend it's all that different from the mainstream.

Hamas leader Khaled Mash'al: "The support we got from Sheikh Al-Qaradhawi is different from the support of anybody else, because of his religious status, his status in terms of morale, and his ability to draw the attention of the nation and the world to the issues of the nation, particularly the issue of Palestine. This support was of great value to us, to the Palestinian people, in the first and second Intifadas, and in all matters pertaining to the Palestinian cause. He has publicly declared his support for the resistance factions, unequivocally and without any hesitation or embarrassment, without fawning over anyone. From day one to the present, the sheikh, may Allah reward him, has not hesitate to support the jihad and the resistance, and to support the fighters, and the resistance factions. One of the most notable manifestations of this support was when we relied - after Allah - on his support of martyrdom operations. He never hesitated to issue rulings in support of these operations, and there were times when we were in dire need of these rulings."

Author has provided details about complex procedures, requirement of mentors, strict and long training that goes into making of a Geisha. There is usual back-stabbing, politics and fights among existing and upcoming Geisha as well. It is interesting to note that in those circumstances, the best that a girl can hope for is to be chosen as Geisha. Without that status their life is that of a servant with little hope of any money or care in old age. The impact of war on society as well as the tradition of Geisha itself is very nicely told. I found the book to be quite good though some aspects of various characters can end up confusing you. I guess that is mainly due to complex Japanese customs and traditions.

We stood outside their house and hugged and prayed over them. I held each of them tight until they cried. They needed a mother's love and protection and the feel of safet, if only for a moment. I kissed them all over their faces and told them I loved them and we would see them again, and help them in the meantime. Isabelle and Johnny begged to give them all the food we had in the van, so we asked them to walk back with us. We walked down that path to the van, praying the whole way. I didn't know until later that night after looking at the pictures that we were all holding hands. Isabelle and Johnny love these girls too, and their hearts were broken and changed that day too.
Written for ages 6 and older this is one of many delightful books in the Katie Woo series. I no longer have children or grandchildren this age but the title reminded me of my 8-year-old granddaughter (kind of a Madame Fullcharge) and I thought she and I would have fun reading it together. She wasn't interested. Said it was too young for her. That might be because she just finishing up her 4th grade brothers book, Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief. Anyway I thought the book was great and I still think she would have enjoyed it. I'll bet if I could have figured out how to get it onto Kindle she may have read it.

It was a simple chance event on a London underground station that got me thinking about luck, chance and randomness and led many years later to my new novel, Wasted. It wasn't an earth-shattering event but it got me thinking. Obsessively. So, I began a novel for adults - I'd two unpublished ones languishing already - about chance, quantum mechanics, and unpredictability, involving repeated multiple possibilities. The idea was that if there is a god - which I know there isn't - he will either play dice or at least have a lot of fun observing. But halfway through, a completely different idea hit me, this time for teenagers. I abandoned god and quantum

14. Changes to the law of this kind should not be driven by public opinion but by serious informed debate.

I attended the opening night of "Greener" in The Gaiety Theatre last night. I'm always worried about going to comedies. I recall literally wanting to run out of "Run for your wife" in the same theatre many years ago. I like comedy to be intelligent and challenging, making you laugh by pointing out the ridiculousness of life and love, and the frailty and wonder of the human condition, rather than a series of obvious one-liners. I need not have worried. From the moment the four main characters commanded the stage, the atmosphere was electric and the tremendous script carried them along admirably.

So, adoptive families must be more exact with their questions, since many of them probably would argue that baby-buying is corruption. Instead of asking, "Do you feel there is wide-spread corruption in China's program?" a better question might be "Do you feel that paying substantial amounts of money for children is adoption corruption? And how wide-spread do you feel this baby-buying is?" It may be that he hedges, like the villager in the opening story, out of a reluctance to air China's dirty laundry, for there is one characteristic of the Chinese that I understand very well, having lived with one for seven years: The Chinese do not like to reveal the dirty secrets of their country, even to friends. It is a tradition and understanding that goes back hundreds of years. We might view it as lying, but the Chinese consider it "saving face."

And then there's the moment when it all stops. Its like pressing the button that has a warning sign hung over it. Or like entering the garden that says "beware of the dog". Sometimes you just gotta beat the odds and see how you turn up around the end. You realize that many people including society, people, extended family, friends expect you to live a certain way. A way that they would approve of. A way that pleases them. It wouldn't bring them real happiness but it would leave them guiltless yet content. So when you stop walking on the sidelines and take a detour to the destination you think you belong to or transform yourself to the person you want to be. The one that really makes YOUR heart happy, you don't see a lot of takers. You don't even find many standing by your side at the end of the journey. You din't fit the bill. You can't be a part of the group coz you're now an extrovert not an introvert. You can't get trodden to the ground. You won't take everyone's bullshit and hide it in your heart but you will give an equally tough fight. Maybe tougher. You won't run to that emo corner and cry it off and emerge like you rose from the dead- So now, this confident, outgoing self is not acceptable.

With Britain looking increasingly likely to secure possession of Palestine, it paved the way for the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a letter addressed to Victor's uncle, Lionel Walter Rothschild, which promised that His Majesty's government would do their utmost to establish 'a national home for the Jewish people' in Palestine. It was a 'declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations', and ultimately led to the creation of Israel. Today Balfour Day is celebrated there on November 2nd.

Needless to say, we didn't run classes that week, but it was interesting to see the areas where we would usually hold yoga classes being used instead for BBQs, and the relaxing quiet poolside area being turned into the local evening rum club!

But this movie is not made for people like me. It is made for a different demographic, which is fine. I knew it going in, but I had heard enough to suggest it would have, like, cross-subcultural appeal. It did not. I would almost rather watch a regular romcom/dramedy or whatever this was because at least it isn't trying to pretend it's all that different from the mainstream.

I added another stripe of ribbon, tic-rack, or other trim to each flag, following the line of the bias tape. Again, I used scraps I had in my trim box - another 8-9 yards total.

The good folks at BulkAmmo.com sent along not only the reduced recoil Rio loads, but also some Sellier & Bellot standard buck, and some S&B 3" magnum buckshot as well. The three loads nicely stack into a good comparison of reduced recoil loads vs. standard, and the 3" magnum shells add a 'spice' to the mix.
Having just been exposed to tombs, mummies and the world of Hatshepsut full-throttle in a middle school text book, it seemed more fitting than ever to face the crowds and potential chaos with three kids ages 6 - 11, all in the name of seeing the real thing. And, with no more strollers or diapers to consider, it was well worth the attempt.
I know I'm just a crass American with no business chiming in on finer points of eti-quette and pro-to-col ... but I do know about a bit about trying mothers-in-law. So, I've taken the liberty of channeling my inner Dear Abby and drafting a little missive of my own:

A movie like Red Tails which narrates the lives of such upstanding historical figures are exactly what the African-American society wants to see in the Big Screen. We're constantly bombarded with negative, & comical depictions of our selves to see a film with respectable figures that reflect us is immensely relieving.

Boris you beauty! Bojo's latest epistle in the DT opens with him at the ArcelorMittal Orbit structure in Stratford; "This sculpture is a masterpiece, far better and more rewarding up close than it appears at a distance". However, he goes on to reveal "everything that is wrong with the BBC and with this country"...and speaking "as one who has just fought a campaign in which I sometimes felt that my chief opponent was the local BBC news"!! Please read what he says about the BBC, Blair and Brown. An opinion which I share of course...
This is an example of churnalism at its laziest worst. Or is it something more sinister? The statement from the court suggested that "Such inventions are a kind of blood libel, and we wonder why the inventor of the story did not continue to describe how we collected the blood of the dog to make our matzah." That might be going too far. But it says a lot about BBC journalism that they imagined that stoning reincarnated dog lawyers to death was the sort of thing Orthodox Jews get up to.

It was a simple chance event on a London underground station that got me thinking about luck, chance and randomness and led many years later to my new novel, Wasted. It wasn't an earth-shattering event but it got me thinking. Obsessively. So, I began a novel for adults - I'd two unpublished ones languishing already - about chance, quantum mechanics, and unpredictability, involving repeated multiple possibilities. The idea was that if there is a god - which I know there isn't - he will either play dice or at least have a lot of fun observing. But halfway through, a completely different idea hit me, this time for teenagers. I abandoned god and quantum

The new characters were incredibly underdeveloped; Angelica, Blackbeard, the Minister, and the mermaid all felt forced upon the audience as if we were suppose to enjoy them, but realistically they were just annoying. Angelica is mad at Jack for taking her virginity (wasn't pirates suppose to be geared for Children?) Blackbeard hides in his cabin for most of the film (wasn't he the scariest pirates of all time?) the Minister falls in love with the mermaid (who in this film can shoot spiderwebs from their wrists like Spider-Man) just because he sees her naked (again, Disney, Pirates, Children?) and the Mermaid needs to shed one tear (there were enough tears of pain from the audience to solve that problem).

That's led Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn and project opponents to make the point that a smaller project, approved through a more transparent process, could have been built without generating so much protest, generating a significant number of jobs.
Melanie hesitated, then blurted out the truth. "It seems sacrilegious. For me, the desert is a mystical place. Somewhere I can be at peace to think things over."
I was thinking, researching and analyzing a lot of information in past several months - particularly, how all those things happening in Thailand (political problems, social unrest) and in the world (economic crisis, "pandemic", rise of transnational corporate fascism), and perhaps fair to say in universe (I wouldn't got into much details about it here, would only say - all the metaphysical and spiritual sides of our existence and current events) - and how ALL that affects me personally. and mainly - what and how I should do about it.
When I was in college, I had also worked on the programming side of radio. One of my favorite projects was a weekly show I initiated, combining the music and folklore of different cultures. (I like to claim I invented world beat.) I knew almost nothing about either, so it was a big adventure each week to go to the university's excellent music-school library and rummage through the record bins.
Dan and I are both so touched by this amazingly generous gift.
Then as the conversation wasn't really going to settle anywhere and it was already getting late, I just moved them on to starting to prep the weeks passage. Esther said, we need to talk. So they went into doing personal time with the text and we talked in someone's room. She was visibly distraught and shared her heart that she was upset in the unbelief that had been coming out in our discussion of what to do about large group. At first I was a little taken aback but as she shared her heart and I reflected back on the conversation, I could see that she was right. We had but Jesus back into a box declaring for him what he could/couldnt do in and through our new people hours after having taken him our of the box at fall con. I felt convicted of my own desire to appease people and unbelief of how Jesus could work at UCI. So we came back together with our leaders and Esther shared her heart, her Holy discontent at what had just transpired and it led to a time of repentance from all of our leaders. That would have been cool enough but in the midst of that time, Jesus ministered to the leader I had prayed with at Fall Con by calling out some of the lies he believed about himself being the weak link in the group as we all affirmed him. It was a beautiful moment of the Holy Spirit doing what was on its agenda, not ours. Please pray that we continue to be open to the interruption of the Spirit.

Tennessee invoked the rule for the 1975 season, during the time when the maximum number of scheduled games was eleven. That season, the Vols traveled to Honolulu for their 12th scheduled game, winning 28-6. There were four non-conference games at home on the schedule that season - Maryland, North Texas State, Colorado State, and Utah - with a fifth on the road (UCLA). I don't know which of those four home NC games was the extra one added due to the Hawaii game. I hope it wasn't North Texas State - the worst Volunteer loss I personally ever witnessed.

A few years ago I discovered 'osteopathic manipulative treatment' (OMT) and the pain in my knee mysteriously disappeared. But by then I was fully in the throes of motherhood and exercise had been off the table for so long that I didn't know how to get it back into my life. I still don't really know how I will accomplish this task, I just know that I must. I need an exercise montage. I need abdominal muscles.
"We won't let any children die. We'll go, but let me handle everything. I can carry you." His fingers stretched out over her hips, slipping under the hem of her shirt to touch bare skin. She sucked in a breath.
But going down through the water to touch the wild man at the bottom of the pond is quite a different matter. The being who stands up is frightening, and he seems even more so now, when corporations do so much work to produce the sanitized, hairless shallow man (2) That's poor Viggo in THE ROAD, a sanitized man re-bearded, trying to be wild in a wild land, having to re-learn the role of the deep, dark masculine and getting it incorrect. No reflection on Viggo, of course, who showed he can bring that shit hardcore in the RINGS films and HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. It's more I think the head-on craftsmanshippy approach to the McCarthy novel -- it gets it too right, maybe, to work. Teardrop on the other hand is the untamed wild man, the kind of guy that creeps you out at first but then somewhere along the way, not sure when, you start to admire him. Isn't that so much better, children, than the other way around? (Beards of Bleakness: WINTER'S BONE VS. THE ROAD)

At the end of the book, there's a little index of particularly significant lines and expressions. There's a certain taste for the florid on display here, perhaps more appropriate to the future author of "Along Rideout Road That Summer", with its insistent echoes of "Kubla Khan", than to the Sargesonian realist of Immanuel's Land (1956).
I was lunching at Gaylords (still there, and still terrific) in Fitzrovia with two contacts, and we were one of just four tables occupied. Afterwards, I strolled round the restaurant-packed area and spoke to some owners. Two admitted they didn't think they'd make it through next year unless things looked up. All said their Christmas bookings were well down before around December 15th. What seemed to be depressing most of them was the total absence of any sign of improvement.
But, a year later, despite significant additional casualties, the vulnerability of the Snatch was becoming so evident that we were to pick it up on this blog, leading in August to a review of the vehicle by then defence secretary Des Browne, and its partial replacement by the Mastiff.
The sheer random chance of such an encounter was part of the danger inherent in the setting. On the other hand, you could encounter a group of giant rats or one cave bear by itself. There needs to be more random elements to things while providing players, in the option of the stone giants, with the opportunity to retreat if and when needed.

With Britain looking increasingly likely to secure possession of Palestine, it paved the way for the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a letter addressed to Victor's uncle, Lionel Walter Rothschild, which promised that His Majesty's government would do their utmost to establish 'a national home for the Jewish people' in Palestine. It was a 'declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations', and ultimately led to the creation of Israel. Today Balfour Day is celebrated there on November 2nd.
I end these musings with a parable I wrote several months ago when I saw then the tendency to hide behind our procedures rather than to step boldly into Holy Truth.

When the girls were seeing their relatives in Northern California, they were taken to see the musical. I was thrilled that they got to see it, and they loved it. And I was even happier that I hadn't broken the budget to take them myself.

Most artists today get inspired by other people, literature, nature etc.; not by goddesses. Camille Claudel inspired the French sculptor Auguste Rodin, and was his muse. He expected her to be there for him, like a goddess would be. By doing so, he prevented her to make name as an artist herself. Recently, some specialists think that many sculptures of Rodin are actually made by Claudel.
First I placed a straight pin through the center of a red felt Pretty Posy, then I placed it through each section of the wheel as I bent it in. Then I used the pin to attach the pinwheel to the eraser of the pencil. I bent the pin down and taped it securely to the pencil so no fingers would get pricked.

2. Bring an Abundance of Water and Food on Hikes: The rule of thumb when hiking is: when half of your water supply is gone, start heading back. Last summer I hiked Upper Yosemite Falls, one of the oldest trails in Yosemite, and leads to the highest waterfall in North America at 2,425 ft. It took me 3 hours to hike up and I tried to conserve my water as much as possible but unfortunately I was not able to. Fortunately, when I finally got to the top there was a benevolent man who was filtering water, from the waterfall, to give to weary hikers. Make sure to bring snacks that are high in protein and carbohydrates such as granola bars and nuts because when the hike says strenuous, it means it!

The story begins last May when, out of the blue, I received an email from Australia. Mick, the sender of said email, had stumbled across my blog when he was researching his family history. He introduced himself and explained that he had been through Kolky before and was very excited to learn that there was someone who he could communicate with now living in this village. His connection to Kolky, as well as other villages in my general area, came from some documents of his wife's side of the family. He also explained that he and Julie were coming to Eastern Europe again (among other places on their 6 week excursion) to retrace some of their steps, do some more searching and continue their investigation. Also he mentioned that one of their stops was Kolky!

When your boyfriend or potential boyfriend is an MD, all the more will a girl's Nancy Drew side act up. An MD is exposed to guests of all colors, shapes and sizes.

My theme for this month is Go Outside. Weird, possibly, but relevant, particularly since in just 21 days I will be swimming 5km for Marie Curie Cancer Care. In the last month I have done precisely no training whatever, so I'm very likely to not make my target of under an hour and a half, but I will complete the 5km, come hell or high water. I plan to go to the gym every day for the next 21 days, starting tomorrow. It's a good theme, I think. I plan to spend regular time outside or at the gym, even if it's only half an hour. Money is tight again now, but going for a walk is free and it's a good way to spend time with my kids, my man or just myself. I tend to do my best thinking in the five minutes it takes me to shower - I've come up with all sorts of speech ideas and blog posts, you wouldn't believe it. I hope that a couple of hours in the gym every day will give me lots of great thinking time and lots of fabulous ideas will flow.

Thus, no doubt soon you will probly hear soon some business leaders or pretend potential self-appointed communist leaders lamenting the lack of organization of the #Occupy movements, describing them as "in choate" (which is a kind of wide penis with no head), or "udderless," or "lacking discernible goals" (like Sporting Gijon). What they are really mean is that there is a ferment of new ideas that therefore could be dangerous and must be curtailed, or at least curtopped. After all, nobody has any idea where a march that goes nowhere might end up. If these peoples weren't too feckless to emigrate we could at least lure them onto a ferry with the promise of jobs in Australia and transport them there. We would never hear of them ever again! But while they are there, in the midst of ordinary, heads-down, knees-back God-fearing punters, fermenting theories without limitations and trying out new processes, such as democracy-never a positive development-they constitute a threat to our docile, passive, obedient way of life. They must be stomped on by square-headed baton-wielding riot police, preferably from up the country, before any new ideas seep out into the public body at large, like a ball of ideological pus.

What ought to be acutely troubling is that the history of revisions to oil and gas resources has heretofore been one of increases. For the first time, we are now seeing not just downward revisions in estimated natural gas resources, but drastic downward revisions. That should tell us that the era of unlimited horizons for fossil fuels has come to a close. All the advanced technology that was supposed to bring unending plenty in the form of fossil fuels is now giving us better estimates of what will be available, namely, not nearly so much as we thought.

Icehouse: Hey Little Girl
I watched the animals eat the jungle
In a section of the Sermon on the Mount in which Jesus challenges us to engage systems of domination with creative nonviolence, he offers this final, perhaps most radical, word, "Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you" (Mt 5:42). This verse challenges our most precious possession, control. When faced with how to best use our resources, this verse challenges our addiction to those resources and the power and privilege of deciding how they are used. Elsewhere, Jesus tells the rich young man that following him requires divesting himself of all his possessions and give to the poor, enacting Jubilee in his own life (Mt 19:16-22; Lk 18:18-30). There is a radical principle here summed up in the Psalms and the Jubilee in Leviticus 25 that God is the only absolute owner. Followers of Jesus are called to hold their possessions loosely as things to be used for God's purposes and not their own accumulation or comfort.

Anyway, I haven't been able to visit the lovely blogs on blogosphere and telling the oh-so-many talented bloggers out there how much I love their recipes and posts. I am sorry. I truly am. I also have been very lazy with replying to the lovely people who have been leaving comments on my blog.

Yet let us analyze these implications in their general form. Starting with an increase in extreme weather, the erosion of soils and weak rock will increase. This will cause more of the imposing landmasses to crumble into the sea leading to an even greater rise in sea level. The changes will exponentially become more and more unpredictable.

I'm stealing a line from a song title today-the famous "Rainy Days and Mondays" by The Carpenters, 1971. Can't you just hear the tune in your head now? If you can, then I can assure you that it's probably going to be playing in there a long time! Or at least that's what happens to me when I am reminded of a song I like-the lyrics and music dance in my brain for hours at a time before fading away, often to appear again when I am trying to fall asleep in the middle of the night. Curses! My brother calls this phenomena 'ear worms'.an image I actually don't even like to think about!

WEALTHY FAMILIES: The first is wealthy families where the older generation has retired or is nearing retirement. Typically, their income is secure and they're concerned primarily with wealth protection and transfer. Agents may find that these wealthy families can take underutilized or under-performing assets and convert them to a permanent life insurance policy, often with the added advantage of a LTC rider. This strategy helps secure their wealth and makes it possible to pass on their assets to heirs in a tax-advantaged way, as well as assuring their long-term security if they need care.

Besides, isn't state-ism itself a religion for most Americans? Do they not honor the state above all else, above even the commandments of a conventional religion they may embrace? If their religion tells them "thou shalt not murder," but the state orders them to murder, then they murder. If the state tells them to rob, to destroy property, and to imprison innocent people, then, notwithstanding any religious strictures, they rob, destroy property, and imprison innocent people, as millions of victims of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and millions of victims of the so-called Drug War in this country will attest. Moreover, in every form of adversity, Americans look to the state for their personal salvation, just as before the twentieth century their ancestors looked to Divine Providence.
I wrote my first story at age twelve. My best friend moved out of the state but she still wanted to know what was going on since she left, so I wrote her a story. I fell in love with storytelling then but realized I could actually be a writer about a year ago.

Even more importantly I think I'm having a rebirth of my spirit. For the longest time I've basically just existed. I've done the bare minimum around the house. It's been a struggle to get that done too. But the last few weeks I've been WANTING to spread my wings and take the time to make the homemade breads and the homemade snacks. I've been wanting to do that stuff. It's almost like I'm being reborn. I don't know what has brought this about. I'm afraid to blink...afraid that it will go away if I do. I still have all the stress and depression in my life....but I'm really trying to not let it affect ME. And maybe that's the whole difference.
CIOs need to think how they can do their jobs differently to provide competitive advantage for their companies. As IT becomes standardised across many industries, it will become harder to differentiate the IT offering. Look harder, competitive advantage is still achievable through innovative uses of IT. The question is whether you as the leader can locate and exploit it?

As things stand at the moment, it is the prevailing view within the Church of England that -- to adopt a minimalist position -- God's Word on the subject of marriage is relatively clear. If there is dissent from that view in the congregation, it is therefore surely the task of the teaching office to correct it.
The time has come - finally - for somebody with a sensible agenda to intervene in the insane race now taking place across the Channel between the markets and Berlin.

I followed my parent's home, even though they weren't aware of my presense. My mom wept all the way while my dad remained silent. He begged my mom to calm down but it all fell on deaf ears. We got home to find the house filled with friends and relatives, my Dad carried my body and laid it on the mat in the living room. Prayers for forgiveness were said, and my parents were advised to stop crying as it wouldn't bring me back. I watched my Mom cry and weep all night as she asked God why He Had to take my life.
The Chairman of the CFR is Robert E. Rubin, who served under Bill Clinton as Treasury Secretary and headed Clinton's National Economic Council. He was a Clinton crony. Rubin's ties to Clinton are interesting, since Bill Clinton was Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University, where he was close to the Jesuit faculty (became Class President in his junior year). Rubin has served on the board of the Center for National Policy (CNP), which is led by it's President, Roman Catholic Tim Roemer (A graduate of the Roman Catholic University of Notre Dame).

This book really was a pleasure to read, a pick up any time kind of read, in between cooking tea or bathing the kids. In fact it took me less than 24 hours to read this book!

While Cathy as a foster mother is obviously an official role, you wouldn't get a story like this from other 'officials' eg: social workers.

Let me tell you, I previously loved Gerard Butler's Phantom but Ramin Karimloo's Phantom made me want to hop through my television set, kick Christine out of the picture and run away with him on the streets of Paris. He was AMAZING with a gorgeous voice and so much raw, sexy emotion. Despite kicking her to the side for the Phantom the gorgeous Sierra Boggess was an awesome Christine with an amazingly hypnotic voice. The height of the play where they sang the theme song was filled with such romance and emotion. I also fell in love with the Music of the Night from Ramin's emotionally raw and sexy voice. I had to grab the soundtrack after to relive the experience over and over again. I simply fell in love with the production!

He also sought to break from the class-conscious conventions of the 1930s and early 40s, when top hat and tails or tuxedos were the norm, by dancing in casual or everyday work clothes, so as to make his dancing more relevant to the cinema-going public. As his first wife, actress and dancer Betsy Blair explained: "A sailor suit or his white socks and loafers, or the T-shirts on his muscular torso, gave everyone the feeling that he was a regular guy, and perhaps they too could express love and joy by dancing in the street or stomping through puddles.he democratized the dance in movies."[14] In particular, he wanted to create a completely different image from that associated with Fred Astaire, not least because he believed his physique didn't suit such refined elegance: "I used to envy his cool aristocratic style, so intimate and contained. Fred wears top hat and tails to the manner born - I put them on and look like a truck driver."[2]

Come to think of it, there's really no difference between Mandela and Taylor. Mandela supporters terrorized the black majority into electing him president in 1994, after South Africa had been at war against communist forces since the mid-1960's. Taylor, following a peace deal that ended the Liberian Civil War, also terrorized the population into electing him president in the 1997 general election.
As someone with Type 1 diabetes (the "real" diabetes, as I like to put it -- the kind you can't help getting), I sometimes wonder when I'll end up retiring, or how long I can escape death. So I wonder how much I should be saving for retirement. Will I get the typical 25-30 year long retirement? Or would I have to retire at 40 to pull that one off? If I work until I'm 65, I could have lots put away, only to die within 2 years if I'm lucky, on the other hand.

A few years ago I discovered 'osteopathic manipulative treatment' (OMT) and the pain in my knee mysteriously disappeared. But by then I was fully in the throes of motherhood and exercise had been off the table for so long that I didn't know how to get it back into my life. I still don't really know how I will accomplish this task, I just know that I must. I need an exercise montage. I need abdominal muscles.

In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the apple cider vinegar, balsamic vinegar, maple syrup, ketchup, red onion, garlic and chile. Stir and let simmer, uncovered, for about an hour. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook for 15 more minutes until the sauce thickens. Stir it often. If it seems too thick, add some water.

Here it is. The real purpose of the visit to Pho 68. Pho with rare beef and braised beef. It looked the part, and tasted it too. They've got the makings of a really good pho here. The stock was excellent. Deep, aromatic and intensely savoury. Wafer thin slices of beef were rare on arrival but cooked through as time progressed, the gentle poaching keeping them tender. The braised beef (brisket I think) was also sliced thin, but had a stronger, minerally flavour. The tendon running through it was soft and gelatinous speaking of long, slow cooking. The noodles, save for a little gluey clump at the top, were cooked just right.

Honeybees, like ants and termites, are considered super-organisms. This means that although the colony is made up of many individuals, none of the individuals can survive without the comradery of one another. The queen, workers and drones each have their job, and each job is essential for the survival of the colony. The swarm of bees occurs for many reasons, not enough space is the most common reason, and when it does happen, it is the equivalent of a colony of bees giving birth to another colony. Leaving the hive in this swarm is the mother of the bees from the initial hive, some her loyal workers, and some drones in a massive, incredible, engagingly powerful performance. They leave the 'parent hive' looking for new nesting grounds, and in the parent hive they just left, grows a new queen, hatching out young sister bees eager to usher her in to the culture of the hive and ensure her safety in her mating flight and new role as new mother of the colony. All of this is done through the true interdependence, constant plebiscites, and instantaneous communication of the colony.. lol.. much like our society works right? Well, in a community with the Hive Mentality it does!

He doesn't know why he's there or what they want, but he does know one thing; he's not talking.

I climbed back into bed, snuggled under the warm covers and tried to get back to sleep, but I am too light a sleeper to turn off high-pitched sounds.

Let's examine the second half of the video. One protester calls out 'Mic check!,' and everyone knows what this means. This guy will speak for us, he has something to say. And if they disagree, they can simply stop passing this person's words along. But in this case he speaks words of de-escalation. We will let you police leave. He's teaching the police a lesson in non-violence. It's amazing to see this at work.

Taiwan is truly a big step ahead of China, when it comes to travel etiquette and service, however, there is still room for improvement. I believe, that we need to give Chinese tourists some time, they will make mistakes and we need to firmly point them out, but they will also learn and improve through time - some more, some less.

The point here is surely not to deride empiricism. Heaven knows conservatism could stand to quit leading with its heart and start thinking more empirically about the world as it is, not the world as they wish it to be. The point, if I'm reading them correctly, is that too many leading voices on the left give themselves over to wonkiness, and presume that their moral convictions are widely shared, such that the only reason anybody could disagree with them is through ignorance (willful or not), or malice.

Once you have your paper cut out in the size you want, I generally use my Xacto knife to score my folds (very gently, I really don't even push, just drag the blade gently across the paper). I score the "pretty side" of my paper, not the back. A ruler helps to keep your lines straight, if you don't trust yourself scoring the paper, you can also line up your ruler and fold against it to keep your folds crisp.

This week, a co-worker of mine sent me a fairly upsetting article about the Virginia Tech shootings of 2007. While you may be thinking that the upsetting part of the article must have been details of the gruesome mass atrocity itself, it was actually something more subtle. It was the fact that after all these years, people still have dangerously little knowledge of the very real, very serious threat posed by domestic violence.

Now, I don't want to sound like I'm crapping on the whole movie, because I actually did enjoy it. I think they did some perfect casting with Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades. They are two of my favorite actors, and I can't think of any two people more perfect for those two roles. I also have a huge crush on the ruggedly handsome Sam Worthington, and Mads Mikkelson is pretty much great in everything he does, and this is no exception. My favorite part of the movie was the whole Medusa scene. From Io explaining the Medusa backstory to Perseus cutting off her head, it is amazing! Its nuts because they all survive these giant ass scorpions, and the three witches (also a cool scene.."a sacrifice!"), but they all drop like flies when it comes to Medusa. She doesn't even have to do anything. She looks at you...you die. End of story.

For example, in 2006 when I first looked into this issue, I used rates of 6 percent and 5.625 percent on the 30- and 15-year loans. I found that over a 15-year period, the cash flow savings had to yield 7 percent, or 1 percent more than the rate on the 30-year loan, to just offset the higher interest rate on the 30-year loan. This can be termed the break-even return on the cash flows. To come out ahead, the borrower has to earn a return above the break-even return.

Tophatter has had a few glitches with their software...the missed alert for my customer being one of them. The other one was their server crashed on Saturday night in the middle of the weekend bazaar auction mostly due to the number of auction attendees in the room, I think. It took them about 20 minutes to reset everything and they were back in business. The staff have been very attentive to their customers...buyers and sellers alike.
This is really just basic scientific competence. If we can't notice the stuff in some way, then believing that it exists is pointless. And if we can notice it, then we should be able to make sure it is where we think it is. If we back it into a corner, it won't vanish into the aether, like the aether did.

"9 Coolest Literary Siblings" by Rose King
I have recently become aware of a theory that suggests as we move closer towards 21st December 2012, Earth's timelines converge and we essentially get down to only two timelines. Timeline 1 which is positive and results in the New World/Golden Age and timeline 2 which results in the New World Order controlling this planet. We are apparently on timeline 1. Can the Nine shed any light on this theory?
Yesterday morning I woke up early, exercised and then decided to bake cookies! It made for a great Saturday morning.
I'd sit up 'til 4 or 5 in the morning, cross legged on the floor hunched over my work, then grab an hours sleep and head off to uni, Man! Being young was awesome! (All those nights paid off though as I ended up winning best folio from our graduating year. Go me!).
He also sought to break from the class-conscious conventions of the 1930s and early 40s, when top hat and tails or tuxedos were the norm, by dancing in casual or everyday work clothes, so as to make his dancing more relevant to the cinema-going public. As his first wife, actress and dancer Betsy Blair explained: "A sailor suit or his white socks and loafers, or the T-shirts on his muscular torso, gave everyone the feeling that he was a regular guy, and perhaps they too could express love and joy by dancing in the street or stomping through puddles.he democratized the dance in movies."[14] In particular, he wanted to create a completely different image from that associated with Fred Astaire, not least because he believed his physique didn't suit such refined elegance: "I used to envy his cool aristocratic style, so intimate and contained. Fred wears top hat and tails to the manner born - I put them on and look like a truck driver."[2]
This book was emotional, and sometimes hard to read. But it was Lisa's lyrical and poetic style of writing that made me stay reading the story. I really loved Janie's character and I thought that throughout the series, she's really grown to accept who she is and what she can do.
The tan color deepened to brown and spread around me. To my astonishment, the area of color developed, like a photo, into a vision of a man with chocolate-brown skin. He superimposed himself over the left side of my face and upper chest and my left arm, and I perceived him as if from the inside and the outside at the same time. I could actually see him, with technicolor clarity, something that had never, ever happened to me before. He looked to be in his mid-thirties, with very round cheeks and prominent eyes, a little like Louis Armstrong. I heard the name "Bertram."

My mom found a pair of these adorable tree trunk side tables at Goodwill for $15. They had weird rectangular black glass tops and the tables themselves were all chipped up.
Jaleel (Urkel) is quickly becoming one of my favourites. He had a bounce back week, performing the SOCKS off his cha-cha adding boatloads of personality. He also had a new easy quality that made the dance look effortless. Great scores, great dance, great week for Urkel.

The time has come - finally - for somebody with a sensible agenda to intervene in the insane race now taking place across the Channel between the markets and Berlin. Not just because, if they don't, scorched earth will be all that's left; but also because both sides are scared - and so the time is right.

What a lie it is to believe that today is just going to be like every other day. It can't be with Jesus in it. His "love and life and grace and truth" are going to fill up today making sure that no "today" will be "just like yesterday." I wonder what we miss because we've stopped believing that Jesus will continue to leave us in awe and wonder, even on "just another Monday?"

I wore my sunsuit when I played on the backyard swing set. But, you couldn't get in the car wearing this. Oh, no, that would not be appropriate. I had to put on another outfit if I was going to leave the yard. That outfit had to stay in the yard. I guess I would have been labeled a tramp or something. Nowadays you can go to Walmart in your pajamas without anyone batting an eye, but back then, you couldn't walk out of the yard in your bathing suit. No sir re Bob.
It reminds me of the first day he started primary school (but so much worse). He was well adjusted, happy, so ready and all smiles. I was all smiles on the outside also but came home and sobbed a million tears. A time of change and also no other littlies at home to focus on as had been my hope and dream.

Montana is the latest establishment in the ever-growing stable of cool-kid haunts owned and operated by Paris graffiti artist-turned-entrepreneur, Monsieur André. He's made a packet for himself by buying up interesting old bars and turning them into dens of beautiful-people iniquity. He launched his Paris bar empire with Le Baron, in the 8th arrondissement, a former brothel that, about four years ago became the place to see, be seen and dance ironically to hits of the 80s.

After making use of a convenient tree-stump chair (carved in situ by a friendly forester), I continue northwards towards Riding Bottom. On the left, more clear-felled pines, very recent judging by the greenness of the snedded branches and freshness of the chips spewed out by the chainsaw. On the right, by contrast, another low stone wall, topped with smoothly serpentine roots and limbs of beech, the boundary of Riding Copse beyond.

It is difficult to make a living from writing. I haven't cracked it yet, although I can see my income growing as I get more interest from foreign publishers and - crucially - manage to keep on producing books. If I compare it, though, to my career in journalism, I'm quite happy. Although I could earn considerably more with a staff job on a national newspaper (and they aren't any easier to come by than getting a book deal), my salary would be pretty much my limit. Whereas a book..well, anything could happen. It's possible for a book to earn for you again and again - a foreign sale here, a film deal there - while you're working on other stuff.
Hope you are all enjoying the weekend with your family and friends.
Lately I've been digging the Los Gatos Creek Trail for my long runs. Even though you are still in the middle of a heavily populated area, parts of the trail make you feel like you are in the middle of nowhere.
We've done a load of work at the White Horse previously (see Rounds 1, 2, 3, 4) but we were asked back to go over a wall that we've done previously (that was looking a little grubby due to the addition of some low-grade graffiti), freshen up the gents toilet door, take care of a tall wall beside the bar and also throw in a few little extras scattered around the place. The White Horse is one of our favourite local boozers so working there is always good fun and design-wise we've obviously run with the whole White Horse identity but given it a little id-iom twist.

It was a simple chance event on a London underground station that got me thinking about luck, chance and randomness and led many years later to my new novel, Wasted. It wasn't an earth-shattering event but it got me thinking. Obsessively. So, I began a novel for adults - I'd two unpublished ones languishing already - about chance, quantum mechanics, and unpredictability, involving repeated multiple possibilities. The idea was that if there is a god - which I know there isn't - he will either play dice or at least have a lot of fun observing. But halfway through, a completely different idea hit me, this time for teenagers. I abandoned god and quantum

Deep in to the first thirty minutes or so of the chick flick and I found myself thinking about story. Just the word and what it means. It was during the scenes in which the graduated "It" girls arrived in Abu Dhabi that my mind began to wander. You see this is where I noticed the story that had pulled me in during the first half hour shifted its focus from story telling to showiness. Somewhere, someone must have stated that the second installment of the movie must be bigger or needed more, I'll use Ms. Bradshaw's word, "sparkle" than its predecessor. Yeah I get it, in a vast sea of sequels they had to dream up some way for theirs to standout, but along the way they forgot about story. And how a well written, relatable tale can pull in and take hold of an audience every time.
Covey amplifies his message by means of wide-ranging examples of "third alternative thinkers". There's the local police force that transformed a crime-plagued community by casting off its entrenched "them against us" mentality. Another example tells the tale of a father who, during the course of one extraordinary evening, rescued his daughter from years of clinical depression. Then there's the judge who brought a swift and peaceful end to a massive environmental lawsuit without setting foot in a courtroom.

So, adoptive families must be more exact with their questions, since many of them probably would argue that baby-buying is corruption. Instead of asking, "Do you feel there is wide-spread corruption in China's program?" a better question might be "Do you feel that paying substantial amounts of money for children is adoption corruption? And how wide-spread do you feel this baby-buying is?" It may be that he hedges, like the villager in the opening story, out of a reluctance to air China's dirty laundry, for there is one characteristic of the Chinese that I understand very well, having lived with one for seven years: The Chinese do not like to reveal the dirty secrets of their country, even to friends. It is a tradition and understanding that goes back hundreds of years. We might view it as lying, but the Chinese consider it "saving face."
WEALTHY FAMILIES: The first is wealthy families where the older generation has retired or is nearing retirement. Typically, their income is secure and they're concerned primarily with wealth protection and transfer. Agents may find that these wealthy families can take underutilized or under-performing assets and convert them to a permanent life insurance policy, often with the added advantage of a LTC rider. This strategy helps secure their wealth and makes it possible to pass on their assets to heirs in a tax-advantaged way, as well as assuring their long-term security if they need care.

Yet let us analyze these implications in their general form. Starting with an increase in extreme weather, the erosion of soils and weak rock will increase. This will cause more of the imposing landmasses to crumble into the sea leading to an even greater rise in sea level. The changes will exponentially become more and more unpredictable. A chaotic patter will emerge which can never be studied. People will panic, but the plain fact is that nature is beyond their control. Sea levels will rise, temperatures will spike, and weather will be out of control. Everything will seem to be pointing toward an inevitable apocalypse.
And by the laughter, I surmise that she could tell without me letting her in on the secret. Apparently, besides my accent deepening into obscurity, I raised my voice several decibels and reverted to my Ghanenglish grammar peppered with Dagbani, something that is significantly different from the speech my Canadian-raised family is used to. And now I'm laughing and blushing, and internally cringing because I feel proud to retain vestiges of my Ghanaian communication skills, but wondering how to balance this maintenance of my slightly shifted identity while re-learning how to connect with Canadians. Especially because I need to sound polished and professional at my upcoming interviews for medicine.
I'm sitting here at 10am in a condo that is much more empty than it was 12 hours ago.

After all, this is no ordinary "comeback". This is a man that was among the best high school sprinters/hurdlers in the country (10.36/13.66) when he graduated in 2000 (= #4 in both events). He then went to the University of Tennessee where he won back to back NCAA sprint doubles as a frosh/soph and set a National Collegiate Record for 200 meters (19.86). He then went pro and following injury in his first pro season came back to win the Olympic 100 meter title in Athens (9.85) and then a sprint double in Helsinki (9.88/20.00) in very inclement weather. The follow up was an equaling of the then WR of 9.77 for 100 meters early the next season.
It has also been suggested that local communities should be given the right to buy up closed pubs and run them themselves. This may work in close-knit villages in the Lake District, but it's unlikely to be of much interest to the neighbours of large urban pubs like the Four Heatons or the Southern Hotel. The most likely result if some kind of "cooling off period" is introduced for people to try to raise the money to buy them is pubs remaining closed and blighted for months with no realistic prospect of ever coming back to life. In general, local communities are more likely to want developers to get on with it and build a block of flats or a supermarket as soon as possible.

In 1982, Björk fell in with Stifgrim, a freeform rock-jazz (as oposed to jazz- rock) duo, comprimising guitarist Steinn Skaptason and vocalist/stand-up comedian Kristinn Jon Gudmundsson. Her sole gig with the band was a part of Iceland's bid to get into the 'Guinness Book Of Records' for the longest ever continuous live performance. Nearly one hundred bands took part in the event, which lasted several weeks, each playing for anything up to twelve hours. Björk's effort was recorded for posterity, and a choice 90-minute 'Best Of' recording of Stifgrim's world-record bid apparently survives on cassette. A week after this occasion, Björk was involved in one other Stifgrim-related event, where she accompanied Kristinn Jon Gudmundsson on guitar as he crooned his way through "Love Me Tender".

Hamas leader Khaled Mash'al: "The support we got from Sheikh Al-Qaradhawi is different from the support of anybody else, because of his religious status, his status in terms of morale, and his ability to draw the attention of the nation and the world to the issues of the nation, particularly the issue of Palestine. This support was of great value to us, to the Palestinian people, in the first and second Intifadas, and in all matters pertaining to the Palestinian cause. He has publicly declared his support for the resistance factions, unequivocally and without any hesitation or embarrassment, without fawning over anyone. From day one to the present, the sheikh, may Allah reward him, has not hesitate to support the jihad and the resistance, and to support the fighters, and the resistance factions. One of the most notable manifestations of this support was when we relied - after Allah - on his support of martyrdom operations. He never hesitated to issue rulings in support of these operations, and there were times when we were in dire need of these rulings."

How can we practice and improve our own self-compassion? First of all, we have to stop being a drill sergeant with ourselves. The use of words "have to", "should" and "ought to" in our life can set us up to fail; as in "I have to go to yoga class every day this week". This is probably not a realistic goal and when you fall short, you're likely to feel bad about it. Instead of "have to" try to motivate yourself to exercise because it feels good or you want to be healthier. Self-compassion is also related to personal happiness. Instead of dwelling on the negatives, make a list of five things that make you happy. It may be getting out into nature, sipping a really good cup of coffee, spending time with a friend.the list goes on.

I end these musings with a parable I wrote several months ago when I saw then the tendency to hide behind our procedures rather than to step boldly into Holy Truth.
That's it. There aren't really any short cuts. People always want short cuts. New acts often want to know how to get an agent. The chances are that any act asking how to get an agent doesn't really need an agent. And when they're at a stage where an agent can help them, they'll find there are agents there offering to help. That's how it works.

A few years ago I discovered 'osteopathic manipulative treatment' (OMT) and the pain in my knee mysteriously disappeared. But by then I was fully in the throes of motherhood and exercise had been off the table for so long that I didn't know how to get it back into my life. I still don't really know how I will accomplish this task, I just know that I must. I need an exercise montage. I need abdominal muscles.
Step 2 - Drop and Bake: Drop batter by tablespoon onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in a well pre-heated 350º F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Do not over-bake. Cookies should be a bit gooey in the center. While warm, they will be very soft on the outside, as well. Allow them to cool on the pan a few minutes and then transfer carefully to a rack to finish cooling. (They will always be somewhat soft because these are gooey fudge brownie cookies, not hard or crunchy cookies.)
It took me almost a month to get 7 things...I really need to write them down as I think of them
Yesterday morning I woke up early, exercised and then decided to bake cookies! It made for a great Saturday morning.

So when Atlanta's premier Master of the Dead calls to ask for help with a vampire on the loose, Kate leaps at the chance of some paying work. Turns out this is not an isolated incident, and Kate needs to get to the bottom of it-fast, or the city and everyone dear to her might pay the ultimate price.

The Royal troops aren't up to much, but are no worse than the Rebels, so don't really merit being Hordes. They use a mix of swords and shields, and polearms, so you could have some Spears if you wanted. Blades seems the best all-round classification, though. The Artillery represents various fanciful weapons employed against Pulgasari, including fireball-hurling catapults, rocket batteries and some amazingly impractical cannon. A magical priestess was also used in an attempt to defeat the monster.

While I was away, my middle son Tim has completed his college courses at UNCW and has moved home in between starting his internship in Washington DC mid-January. He graduates in May with his degree in Recreation Therapy. He had a nice surprise waiting for me when I pulled into the driveway at 11PM two days before Christmas. The lighted deer and Christmas tree were in the front yard set up and glowing, attached to the Christmas lights lining the front porch my oldest son, Kerry Lee, had helped me put up during the warm spell right after Thanksgiving. Then when I came into the house I saw that Tim had set up and decorated the Christmas tree, hung the Christmas stockings for everyone including the dogs and cats, and had decorated the rest of the house as well! What a blessing!
Before I get lost in embarrassingly worshipful paeans about the pieces on Axl Rose ("with the wasp-man sunglasses and the braids and the goatee, he reminds one of the monster in Predator, or of that monster's wife on its home planet") and Michael Jackson ("a god moves through him; the god enters, the god leaves") and the rest, let me stop and explain.

And then there was the wind! The picture above shows the backyard of our son after the storm. That heavy propane grill was blown over - it took two of us to put it back. If you look carefully at the picture above (it can be enlarged), you'll see the leg of a chair that went through their fence. It was later reported that a tornado touched down a couple of miles from their house - I'm glad we didn't know about that at the time!

When was the last time you gave your windows any attention? Last week? Last month? Last year? Its spring and a great time to have a "cleaning" challenge. This week I am challenging you to open up the drapes, pull up the blinds, and let the sunshine in! We are going to be washing the windows! Throughout the rest of April, we will be concentrating on spring cleaning during the weekly challenges. Its always more fun cleaning with others.
Written for ages 6 and older this is one of many delightful books in the Katie Woo series. I no longer have children or grandchildren this age but the title reminded me of my 8-year-old granddaughter (kind of a Madame Fullcharge) and I thought she and I would have fun reading it together. She wasn't interested. Said it was too young for her. That might be because she just finishing up her 4th grade brothers book, Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief. Anyway I thought the book was great and I still think she would have enjoyed it. I'll bet if I could have figured out how to get it onto Kindle she may have read it.

Anyway, I haven't been able to visit the lovely blogs on blogosphere and telling the oh-so-many talented bloggers out there how much I love their recipes and posts. I am sorry. I truly am. I also have been very lazy with replying to the lovely people who have been leaving comments on my blog. I know its the rudest thing possible, but please know each and every comment you leave makes my day.
Come to think of it, there's really no difference between Mandela and Taylor. Mandela supporters terrorized the black majority into electing him president in 1994, after South Africa had been at war against communist forces since the mid-1960's. Taylor, following a peace deal that ended the Liberian Civil War, also terrorized the population into electing him president in the 1997 general election.
Not only did I rework that original block, but I have since done more applique' work (that Scrappy Dresden Plate quilt I'm working on requires applique', as do the monthly minis for Sandy's monthly QAL) and now in charge of the design for our next guild Opportunity (raffle) Quilt for 2014. Do you know what I've chosen for us to do? You guessed it if you said, "an applique' quilt"! I'll save that whole story for another day, but for now, I want to tell you about an idea that our friend, Flo shared during our coffee group.

In 2010, The Economist collated these (and many other) instances together and laid the blame for the recent upsurge in universal value-bashing squarely at the door of CCP conservatives who feared that embracing universal values would also mean acknowledging the superiority of the West's political system. The truth is that the party would much prefer it if China had its own 'values with Chinese characteristics,' rather than troublesome universal values they would have to share hand-in-hand with the decadent West.
Sort of the flip side of the last post when I was wondering what we should commit ourselves to crafting as a group. What do you think you is worth some money in the Station Cash Store? What should we consider buying?
"The Wallflower" rose to No. 2 on the rhythm-and-blues charts in 1954. As was often the case in those days with records by black performers, a toned-down version was soon recorded by a white singer and found a wider audience: Georgia Gibbs's version, with the title and lyric changed to "Dance With Me, Henry," was a No. 1 pop hit in 1955. (Its success was not entirely bad news for Ms. James. She shared the songwriting royalties with Mr. Ballard and the bandleader and talent scout Johnny Otis, who had arranged for her recording session. (Mr. Otis died on Tuesday.)

Last but certainly not least is Katie from Miss Dixie! Katie was kind enough to agree to post even though she just went on a trip of her own last weekend, too! Her blog is full of shopping tidbits, interiors, and many other things but my favorite part about her blog is all of the personal touches she adds. You should see how she decorated her laundry room and how gorgeous her wedding was. But seriously, if you haven't seen them go right now. Thank you again Katie, you're the best!

The Chairman of the CFR is Robert E. Rubin, who served under Bill Clinton as Treasury Secretary and headed Clinton's National Economic Council. He was a Clinton crony. Rubin's ties to Clinton are interesting, since Bill Clinton was Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University, where he was close to the Jesuit faculty (became Class President in his junior year). Rubin has served on the board of the Center for National Policy (CNP), which is led by it's President, Roman Catholic Tim Roemer (A graduate of the Roman Catholic University of Notre Dame).

I'm sitting here at 10am in a condo that is much more empty than it was 12 hours ago. My tv is gone, my coffee table is gone, and most importantly the boxes of my exes stuff that i had hidden behind the couch for the past 5 months is gone. I didn't know how it would go today. My last relationship was a tricky one. I'd have to say it was honestly the worst and most dysfunctional relationship I've ever had in my entire life (i've had a total of 3 boyfriends).

There was that time I watched my father in a televised drama where he was portraying yet another down and out character. There was a part where he was cold and shivering and sad, and I am told I came out from under the dining table that was my favourite hiding spot and offered my blankie to the television set saying "Here daddy, you can have my blankie, you don't have to be cold!" The adults thought that was the sweetest, funniest thing ever, but to my four year old mind, my father was suffering and I wanted to help. I knew he was pretending, but could I be really, really sure he wasn't actually cold?
"Our results suggest that long-term meditators have white-matter fibers that are either more numerous, more dense or more insulated throughout the brain," Dr. Luders said in a statement to the media.

We'd decided on going to the Cartoon Museum in London when we read about an exhibition of work by one of the greatest cartoonists of all time, H.M. Bateman. He was the man who pioneered short or no-caption drawings which were such a welcome contrast to the rather heavily laboured pieces favoured by the Edwardians and Victorians. He also did fabulous caricatures, but was best known for his series about 'The Man Who.', which included toe-curling embarrassing moments, such as a guardsman who dropped his rifle on parade and a junior officer who ate the colonel's starter at a regimental dinner. He did superb irate older men with popping monocles and incandescent eye-brows. We both laughed outright many times in the exhibition - and nobody went Shhhhh. It's a great place: very cheap to get in, an excellent shop and the show itself was superb: very well-lit and arranged and with full, detailed captions. I can report that the Cartoon Museum hasn't caught the almost universal disease of British museums who seem to think their visitors are either ill-informed half-wits, or pre-school children.

Journey Through the Past
I can tell you how NOT to go about things. One, clean yourself and your truck up. If I were to have land and Homeboy showed up in his 4X4 with dog boxes and a bumper sticker that read "Hog Hunters Do It In The Brush" I'll probably call the cops. Think about that, seriously. The South is known for its rednecks, but that sorta thing won't garner positive attention.
The sad part of this journey to attain mind-body synchronization is that it is implicitly flawed by human hubris. Man's character flaw of ego hides from man the manner in which Jiriki, salvation from within, can be attained. It is for this reason that one who desires to embrace Jiriki Kata-Do, inner salvation from Kata, must abandon and surrender human hubris.

In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the apple cider vinegar, balsamic vinegar, maple syrup, ketchup, red onion, garlic and chile. Stir and let simmer, uncovered, for about an hour. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook for 15 more minutes until the sauce thickens. Stir it often. If it seems too thick, add some water.

One day he caught me and I tried to listen to his bizarre imaginings. I felt sorry for him. A couple of his teeth were gone. But he was too loud, too edgy, too nonsensical. Never again. He can have my change. But this performance? I don't have the time.
In five stories, Christie allows the murderer to escape justice (and in the case of the last three, implicitly almost approves of their crimes); these are The Witness for the Prosecution, The Man in the Brown Suit, Murder on the Orient Express, Curtain and The Unexpected Guest. (When Christie adapted Witness into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed.) There are also numerous instances where the killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but instead dies (death usually being presented as a more 'sympathetic' outcome), for example Peril at End House, Death on the Nile, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Crooked House, Appointment with Death, The Hollow, and Secret Adversary. In some cases this is with the collusion of the detective involved. Five Little Pigs, and arguably Ordeal by Innocence, end with the question of whether formal justice will be done unresolved.

When we allow ourselves to let go of wanting the other to fill us up, when we let ourselves be real, as we are, another energy comes through our body and being. It will charge our entire being with a presence, a force that is absolutely free of wanting. We feel open, grounded, free, humble and powerful - zero and everything. It is as through our body, heart and soul simultaneously flower in reverential awe of the moment. This force is an exquisite expression of the flower of life itself.
I remember when my babies were born I would hold them and stare at them for hours. I would study every facet of their face every day. It was such a joyous time to bond with them and appreciate every miraculous thing about them. They were beautiful, amazing little beings and I could stare at them forever.

In 1982, Björk fell in with Stifgrim, a freeform rock-jazz (as oposed to jazz- rock) duo, comprimising guitarist Steinn Skaptason and vocalist/stand-up comedian Kristinn Jon Gudmundsson. Her sole gig with the band was a part of Iceland's bid to get into the 'Guinness Book Of Records' for the longest ever continuous live performance. Nearly one hundred bands took part in the event, which lasted several weeks, each playing for anything up to twelve hours. Björk's effort was recorded for posterity, and a choice 90-minute 'Best Of' recording of Stifgrim's world-record bid apparently survives on cassette. A week after this occasion, Björk was involved in one other Stifgrim-related event, where she accompanied Kristinn Jon Gudmundsson on guitar as he crooned his way through "Love Me Tender".
It's been a while - since December, in fact - since I pulled out the brew equipment. Well, with the return of summer, and my recently purchased, though not yet assembled MLT, the time has come to make some beer. Now, the little Brew Devil inside of me is pulling me in a few different ways, and I have a couple of obligations to previously conjured brews, so the brew schedule is filling up fast. Here's a quick run down.

So when is all of this stuff going to be pressed into service to make beer? Well, that's a question best answered by the folks at Flying Fish (they say test brewing could start in May). But whenever that day comes, to quote Dr. Emmet Brown, "you're gonna see some serious shit."
So, adoptive families must be more exact with their questions, since many of them probably would argue that baby-buying is corruption. Instead of asking, "Do you feel there is wide-spread corruption in China's program?" a better question might be "Do you feel that paying substantial amounts of money for children is adoption corruption? And how wide-spread do you feel this baby-buying is?" It may be that he hedges, like the villager in the opening story, out of a reluctance to air China's dirty laundry, for there is one characteristic of the Chinese that I understand very well, having lived with one for seven years: The Chinese do not like to reveal the dirty secrets of their country, even to friends. It is a tradition and understanding that goes back hundreds of years. We might view it as lying, but the Chinese consider it "saving face."
Now that I can feel that sense of "enough" in my body, and I can trust it enough to take action around it, I don't struggle nearly as much with the wants, desires, and wishes that used to plague me. I know what is enough. For most of my life, for most things in my life, I have enough. I am enough. There is enough.

Our people are increasingly suspicious or even frightened by the actions of their own government. It can no longer be trusted to do what's right by them. It seems to be driven by agendas that have nothing to do with their interests or well-being. In such circumstances, an independent judiciary becomes more important. It's a bulwark against tyranny. No wonder its reputation is under attack through ill-informed and self-serving comments by politicians and the appointment of questionable characters to the bench.

Next, write down all the skills you need to learn or to work on. If you are just getting started with writing, you may find this difficult. If people have made comments on your writing, you can use those comments to make your list. If, for instance, you have been told that your characters are not believable or your descriptions fuzzy, then the skills of creating characters and writing description go on your list. Or try this: read over a piece of writing by your favorite author, writing you consider excellent. Now write down all the things the writer does that make this piece so good. How many of these things can you do now? How many of them do you need to learn how to do?

My memoir on adopting my daughter from China was perhaps the hardest thing I ever wrote mainly because at the same time that I was trying to understand what was going on, what this sudden unexpected journey in the middle of my life actually meant, to capture in words what it actually felt like- I was trying to get others to understand, to feel all of this at the same time.
The BHA has written to all the riders concerned and expressed their disappointment at the conduct of riders at the start, especially bearing in mind that considerable emphasis was placed on this aspect of the race during the pre-race Jockey's Briefing.

Fitzpatrick said that although he could see the potential connection between answering 50 questions against a ticking clock in a classroom and being able to process information at a rapid pace on the field, he wouldn't read too much into a prospect's test scores. "Dan Marino has a low score when he took it, right?" He asked. "I think his career turned out just fine."

And it's not just Arabs. For instance, one member of the organization's finance committee, Genevieve Lynch, was a participant of the National Iranian American Council. Judith Barnett, a former registered agent for Saudi Arabia, is a donor and is prominent on the J Street Advisory Council. while Nancy Dutton, who until 2008 represented the Saudis as an attorney against her fellow Americans donates to J Street's political action committee which has been financing anti-Israeli congressional candidates.

Hamas leader Khaled Mash'al: "The support we got from Sheikh Al-Qaradhawi is different from the support of anybody else, because of his religious status, his status in terms of morale, and his ability to draw the attention of the nation and the world to the issues of the nation, particularly the issue of Palestine. This support was of great value to us, to the Palestinian people, in the first and second Intifadas, and in all matters pertaining to the Palestinian cause. He has publicly declared his support for the resistance factions, unequivocally and without any hesitation or embarrassment, without fawning over anyone. From day one to the present, the sheikh, may Allah reward him, has not hesitate to support the jihad and the resistance, and to support the fighters, and the resistance factions. One of the most notable manifestations of this support was when we relied - after Allah - on his support of martyrdom operations. He never hesitated to issue rulings in support of these operations, and there were times when we were in dire need of these rulings."

Now that a few days have passed, I look back on that Chrysalis weekend with such joy. I don't think about the logistics of it all, I think about how present God was throughout it. With God's help, that weekend was flawless. And as I sat on Sunday listening to these girls talk about how positively affected they were by this weekend.. I knew at that very instant that every bit of sweat and tears was worth it.
Sitting with a pint of larger and a gaggle of friends (maybe a boyfriend). Feeling a moral victory as City were not ,all, about money. The great fan loyalty that saw season ticket sales rise when we were relegated. Living with a boyfriend on the street next to the ground, watching the people streaming past the house, the streets filled with cheers. Catching sight of players in bars, a drink with a football player.

Having a good reputation is something you want in the music business. It sounds like obvious good advice for artists to tell them to be able to play well with others, but this also needs to include others you might not like or want to play with. In todays music business, you may come across and have to work with people you don't like, they might be doing things you cant stand, but bashing them excessively online or around others is not going to help you get what you want in the end.

For the sake of simplicity I've been writing this story with the subconscious goal of keeping each section of each chapter in a particular characters head. According to my little yellow Post-It notes in Writer I start slipping from that practice here. I slip into floating point of view briefly at the end of this chapter when I venture inside Roland's head for a paragraph. The note tells me I should rewrite, but I've read this section over and over and I don't see the slip of POV as distracting. At this point I am desensitized to any writerly wrong doing I may have performed here. I think the chapter flows properly and the brief switch in POV is harmless. However, I'm not an editor and I'm not reading the story for the first time either. What do you guys think? And do you think that because I called your attention to it?
P.S. Not to beg, but know of any specific job opportunities in NYC, or have any ideas? I'm looking, since I may need something standard until I can launch my dreams...Any assistance, advice would be greatly appreciated.

Personally, I go over Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Tumblr and scroll up and down, click on links, read, comment, like, circle, hangout, reblog, retweet, share, email, troll and all the things possible of what social media has offered us today.

2. Bring an Abundance of Water and Food on Hikes: The rule of thumb when hiking is: when half of your water supply is gone, start heading back. Last summer I hiked Upper Yosemite Falls, one of the oldest trails in Yosemite, and leads to the highest waterfall in North America at 2,425 ft. It took me 3 hours to hike up and I tried to conserve my water as much as possible but unfortunately I was not able to. Fortunately, when I finally got to the top there was a benevolent man who was filtering water, from the waterfall, to give to weary hikers. Make sure to bring snacks that are high in protein and carbohydrates such as granola bars and nuts because when the hike says strenuous, it means it!

Admiral Ororod did not garner the complete respect of those under him; he had connections, came from a well-to-do family with important political ties, more a bureaucrat with aspirations for a political career than a military career, he ran his detachment more like a business than the military unit it was. He may have been far from the most inspirational of fleet officers, but his politically minded motivations also helped to ensure that the Orion was one of the top training vessels in all the fleet.
.HOW I FEEL NOW.
During the evenings the crickets and cicadas sing. Combined with roosters, hens, ducks, wild birds, yowling skinny cats and the nightly chorus sent up by the campus's dog population this can all add up to quite the racket at bed time. Speaking of ducks, on my walk home from the office yesterday a tiny yellow duckling waddled across the open-air hallway I was threading my way through, looking lost yet determined. I hope he's found his way to safety, it's a jungle out there.
I just didn't know what to do now
I've been dating a little bit, and its been fun. Both men and women. There is one very pretty grrrrr in Ellensburg but it seems like we are both gravitating in different directions. I've found someone that I think I really like, and I'm a little surprised because it is not someone that would ever catch my eye...I mean, the kind of person that you go by in the grocery store and don't even notice. But once you make yourself look, well, his heart is like a kaleidoscope of radiant gems and syrups. My own juices are flowing with the bright heat of summer, and love is floating with the fuzzy cotton tree seeds in the wind.
I was reading something about trust the other day and I apologize for not remembering where I read it or who to give credit to but the thought has been percolating in my mind so much so I had to write about it in my own words.

After all, this is no ordinary "comeback". This is a man that was among the best high school sprinters/hurdlers in the country (10.36/13.66) when he graduated in 2000 (= #4 in both events). He then went to the University of Tennessee where he won back to back NCAA sprint doubles as a frosh/soph and set a National Collegiate Record for 200 meters (19.86). He then went pro and following injury in his first pro season came back to win the Olympic 100 meter title in Athens (9.85) and then a sprint double in Helsinki (9.88/20.00) in very inclement weather. The follow up was an equaling of the then WR of 9.77 for 100 meters early the next season.

Holy shit. I had no idea how isolated we've become. We do not go out as a family. WHATSOEVER. Going out to dinner is, simply, out of the question. The likelihood of Bennett acting out, or throwing his food across the restaurant if something goes wrong, while not HIGH, is still high enough to where Jennifer and I both do not risk it.
Audrey subsequently suffered a heart attack, brought on in part by the stress of dealing with her feud with David over the ownership of what was formerly her hair salon. She had earlier signed over her interest in the salon to David, as she intended to elope with Lewis Archer (Nigel Havers) and to buy a hotel in Greece. She now wants the salon back.

Last but certainly not least is Katie from Miss Dixie! Katie was kind enough to agree to post even though she just went on a trip of her own last weekend, too! Her blog is full of shopping tidbits, interiors, and many other things but my favorite part about her blog is all of the personal touches she adds. You should see how she decorated her laundry room and how gorgeous her wedding was. But seriously, if you haven't seen them go right now. Thank you again Katie, you're the best!

I wore my sunsuit when I played on the backyard swing set. But, you couldn't get in the car wearing this. Oh, no, that would not be appropriate. I had to put on another outfit if I was going to leave the yard. That outfit had to stay in the yard. I guess I would have been labeled a tramp or something. Nowadays you can go to Walmart in your pajamas without anyone batting an eye, but back then, you couldn't walk out of the yard in your bathing suit. No sir re Bob.
I am also into bento making for my girl . This is not an easy task but I try my best to learn from blogs and books. I hope I can sustain this 'bentoing' but for how long I have no idea....cos I have to wake up as early as 5am then rush everything by 630am and to leave home by 645am.....rushing like mad right? But when my girl and boy told me that they love the food I prepared for them...I think its just worth it =)

Because of my goal to not be induced, I wasn't focusing much on my due date. I just figured he would be late, and that he would come when he was ready. I was hoping for an Easter baby, just because I thought that would be fun. I scheduled an appointment for a consultation with a surgeon in Seattle about my hernia for March 30th. That made my doctor a little upset- he told me he didn't want me travelling that close to my due date. I thought he was just sore about my decision to see a surgeon in Seattle rather than a local one. We disagreed on several things relating to my hernia, but that isn't really important.

Oh, to be sure, you have to soften up the public with a decades-long PR campaign bashing teachers, vilifying their unions, trashing schools, and condemning public education in general, all the while promising the sun, moon, and stars for privatization, which is the ultimate charter goal. Voila! You've got your chance.

I can imagine them saying that it is my time to give back to my father for all he has done for me. That there are things I will be learning in this experience, marathon that it is. They would point out that it is an opportunity for me to develop and express a selfless love. And they would remind me that my father, even in his condition, matters to God. His soul is intact even as his mind is fading.

We stood outside their house and hugged and prayed over them. I held each of them tight until they cried. They needed a mother's love and protection and the feel of safet, if only for a moment. I kissed them all over their faces and told them I loved them and we would see them again, and help them in the meantime. Isabelle and Johnny begged to give them all the food we had in the van, so we asked them to walk back with us. We walked down that path to the van, praying the whole way. I didn't know until later that night after looking at the pictures that we were all holding hands. Isabelle and Johnny love these girls too, and their hearts were broken and changed that day too.

First of all, for those who don't know I have 3 adopted siblings. They are all from the Philippines. Actually there are six kids in my family and our order goes a bit like this - biological, adopted, biological, adopted, biological, adopted. :) My parents were also foster parents for about 8 years, so we had infants in and out of our house - most in which (I think) were adopted. So as you can tell adoption has been a pretty big part of my life. I always knew I wanted to adopt. It just seemed like something I was suppose to do when having a family. My husband's family is a bit different from mine - he's the only one! Although we came from different types of families, we both knew we wanted to have a family eventually.
Anyway, yesterday and today have been full of tears. I always cry when I leave home, even though I know I'm gonna be back in less than 4 months anyway. I just miss my family, but I will see them soon.

For me it didn't get bad until after the D&C. I suppose I assumed that it would be the same this time. But then I have to remind myself that it was almost as if I had 3 weeks to deal with the shock of it all before I actually "lost" my baby. This time I knew that I couldn't deal with the emotional turmoil associated with waiting for things to happen naturally as my body obviously has a very difficult time letting go. I gave myself one day to let in soak in, to say goodbye to my sweet child, and then took Cytotec again (which this time didn't even make me bleed at all) and had the D&C on Thursday.

The guru, or acaryadeva, as we learn from the bona fide scriptures, delivers the message of the absolute world, the transcendental abode of the Absolute Personality, where everything nondifferentially serves the Absolute Truth. We have heard so many times: mahajano yena gata sa pantha ("Traverse the trail which your previous acarya has passed"), but we have hardly tried to understand the real purport of this sloka. If we scrutinizingly study this proposition, we understand that the mahajana is one, and the royal road to the transcendental world is also one. In the Muaka Upaniad (1.2.12) it is said:
But Tom Hiddleston. Man, is Tom Hiddleston good. He plays Loki the same way he played the character in Thor, not as a cartoon villain but as an at times sympathetic man torn between the way he regards his brother with both familial love and burning jealousy. There are scenes between Thor and Loki where you can almost see Loki willing to put an end to all of this, but too far in to stop now. Loki is not absolutely a villain, and none of the heroes are absolutely heroes. They all have doubts and moments of cynicism. It's what elevates the movie beyond merely a collection of character moments and an action-packed third act: the continuing thread about what the nature of heroism really is, where it comes from, and how it can be used to affect the world. It was there in Captain America: The First Avenger when Steve Rogers told Dr. Erskine "I don't want to kill anybody. I don't like bullies. I don't care where they're from." It was there when Thor learned how to wield his power for others and Tony Stark conquered his daddy issues.
The key to this entire problem was failure to understand Paul's ministry and message. Were Lysius to side with the Jews, he would be as lost as they. Fortunately, he had Paul in a semi-private audience. The Jews no longer had a gospel message for God was no longer dealing with them. To Paul was given the gospel of the grace of God for so we read in Ephesians 3:2.

If you don't, well, you need to catch up on your classic Christmas movies. Commie. Also, what the hell? Barenaked Ladies made one helluva Christmas album a few years ago, with new songs and traditional. And it's awesome. Try throwing that in every once in a while instead of another rendition of Frosty the Snowman.

It may take extra effort to find all the needed supplies since everything is just tossed willy-nilly in there, but I refuse to go another weekend without crafting in my own space. So that will be my end goal for this week: make one card in remodeled craft room. How hard that that be? Really? LOL LOL
I really enjoy the Windsor's scones, too. They always have two choices of tasty scones, a seasonal one such as cranberry or pumpkin and a classic one like maple or oat. They are very good. Not the best I've had (that honor would go to these incredible scones I had in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn, I think it was at Choice Greene, this magical artisanal cheese, grocer, baker and charcuterie shop near BAM, scones that were so authentically British and perfect in every way, they were better than some I've had in England! I also love the very Scottish/Irish scones at Babington's Tea Room in Rome, which are dry and dense and crumbly and are served with freshly whipped clotted cream and Italian strawberry jam. Babington's is a 19th-century tea room started up by two Englishwomen and it's like stepping back in time. Some noted British food critics have claimed it's more of an "English tea experience than one you'll find in London, very classic."

What is the proper response to betrayal? Or even the natural response? Jonas' mother shuns her son but, for many, there will be the often kneejerk response to pay the person back: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth and infidelity for infidelity. So they go out and screw the guy's best friend or the first person they meet in a bar. And that's what happens here. Not the best friend, the bar. When Eva finds out exactly what (or, to be more precise, who) her husband has been doing she goes out, picks up a guy in a bar, goes back to his flat and lets him have his way with her.

The biggest thing is with Oldest and her boyfriends daughter, who's 3. The mom just up and left for the 4th time, leaving the daughter with Oldest and Boyfriend. No contact for over a month! Oldest and Boyfriend went to a lawyer to see what they could do, and the lawyer said NOTHING. Yep, nothing. A judge in our county won't rule against a mom who has several domestic violence charges called to her home, who has pulled a gun on her current boyfriend several times, has a mental illness, and has had several attempted suicides!

I opened my eyes and looked up at him, desperately wanting to ask and yet terrified of the answer. What would I do if he had been doing what I'd thought he had? Would that be break-up worthy? Would I give him a second chance? Would I ever be able to trust him again?

Montana is the latest establishment in the ever-growing stable of cool-kid haunts owned and operated by Paris graffiti artist-turned-entrepreneur, Monsieur André. He's made a packet for himself by buying up interesting old bars and turning them into dens of beautiful-people iniquity. He launched his Paris bar empire with Le Baron, in the 8th arrondissement, a former brothel that, about four years ago became the place to see, be seen and dance ironically to hits of the 80s.
This year tested that faith. There is no way around it: This was a lousy year in sports. Scandal. Disgrace. Crime. The horror in and around sports rose to previously unimagined depths -- the empire struck back, the dark side reigned. Penn State dominated the news, but there were charges elsewhere, in too many places, in Miami and Ohio State and Syracuse and, well, who could keep up? Players went on strike. Owners locked out. Fan favorites left town. Legends went on trial. Concussions. Perjury. PEDs.

I'm not prepared for the breaking down of my best friend, for the suffering and slow burn of flames licking at all she holds dear, her light and her laughter and her little family, her safe haven and her confidence. I'm not sure if I'm willing to drag her through this with me.

In a town where the economy has largely collapsed, the project of connecting local small food-producers with consumers in nearby cities is motivated more by the possibility of job creation than it is by pursuit of culinary nirvana.
I was lunching at Gaylords (still there, and still terrific) in Fitzrovia with two contacts, and we were one of just four tables occupied. Afterwards, I strolled round the restaurant-packed area and spoke to some owners. Two admitted they didn't think they'd make it through next year unless things looked up. All said their Christmas bookings were well down before around December 15th. What seemed to be depressing most of them was the total absence of any sign of improvement.

You know. boom towns don't last forever.
Stomachs dropped at the images of Justice, a mixed breed puppy that was doused in lighter fluid and set ablaze earlier this month. He had second and third-degree burns over 70 percent of his body and died 10 days later.

I took Hypnobirthing classes. Did I believe they'd work? I had my doubts. See, I have serious issues with my baby's father. No partner to rely on. A rocky relationship with my mother who is my birth partner by proxy, bless her, and who is dealing with some serious bullshit at home with my teenage siblings, bless them. (The first 'bless' was sincere, the second was conflicted.) Aaaand a tendency to list reasons I can't accomplish stuff.

There was a problem with Shirley's printer which held up the order slightly and so she was extremely kind and sent me this other Love design as a special surprise, and it's now brightening up the side of my wardrobe. As mentioned before I do not like the wardrobes in my bedroom and they desperately need painting cream but now I see this pretty print instead of the wood and I just adore it.

A few years ago I discovered 'osteopathic manipulative treatment' (OMT) and the pain in my knee mysteriously disappeared. But by then I was fully in the throes of motherhood and exercise had been off the table for so long that I didn't know how to get it back into my life. I still don't really know how I will accomplish this task, I just know that I must. I need an exercise montage. I need abdominal muscles.

As things stand at the moment, it is the prevailing view within the Church of England that -- to adopt a minimalist position -- God's Word on the subject of marriage is relatively clear. If there is dissent from that view in the congregation, it is therefore surely the task of the teaching office to correct it.

Anyway, we soon found out that if you never spoke, the zombie outbreak didn't happen to most people. Much like the movie Pontypool, where the virus had attached to language itself. So a lot of us were walking from room to room, but really keeping conversation at a minimum, or not at all. Things were looking up near the end, but the whole dream was still kind of disturbing.
Anyway, one hour, one Crayola marker, one pair of scissors several straight pins, and one sewing machine later, I have this fitted pencil skirt. It's a little too short for the office, but I'm hoping the tights will hide my legs enough that no one will complain.
There are experts who believe that taking even one drink may be endangering the health of the developing baby. One thing is clear, when an expectant mother has an alcoholic beverage- a beer, a glass of wine or a cocktail- her unborn child takes the same drink. It goes directly through her bloodstream and into the placenta.
Honestly speaking, I haven't given much thought to praising this third book of the Caster Chronicles based on its first few chapters. All the way down through the middle parts, I have always told myself of how I find it boring me already and losing its "spark." Perhaps because I thought since this was already the third release, and the authors have already ran out of ideas and plots for the story. Basically, I can't help but compare the events to the former ones, that somehow, it already looks like the same plot over and over again only that this time, it is in a different package - the same visions, dreams, kelting, prophecies, shadowing songs, moons, bindings, and a whole lot more caster businesses that only readers of the book could understand.

As a woman I would suggest to other women who find themselves constantly in these scenarios to allow your man to handle the situation. If he chooses to play along and think it's cute to have you in an awkward situation while he is feeding the egos of disrespectful floozies testing your resolve then toss his sorry insecure drama seeking ass aside. He is not worth your time nor energy in the long haul.

The first step in making effective change in our behavior is awareness. So as a start, copy the list of offensive behaviors. After every sales call honestly evaluate yourself through the eyes of your prospect. For example, if you talked for more than 20% of the time, you are probably guilty of all of the first four offensive behaviors.
I've mentioned many reasons for having "photowednesdays" on this blog. some reasons are current events love of Brooklyn and keeping my idle hands from being the devils playthings. I've probably also mentioned it's not always easy to find a new pic of something Brooklyn-centric or born that's interesting. I never want photo Wednesdays to turn into a catalogue of cliched pics of the bridge or the arch.

Before I get lost in embarrassingly worshipful paeans about the pieces on Axl Rose ("with the wasp-man sunglasses and the braids and the goatee, he reminds one of the monster in Predator, or of that monster's wife on its home planet") and Michael Jackson ("a god moves through him; the god enters, the god leaves") and the rest, let me stop and explain.
Ogres are considered the weakest stunty team, even though they can have 6 Ogres (and other Ogre Stars that are usually too pricey to squeeze in) because their stunties are only strength 1.

This is a unique album, wedged between the previous 'Glam-esque' releases (although to be fair, Big Beat was starting to head towards a more American sound), and prior to their full blown move to the Euro Electronic sound. By the mid 70's, Sparks were pretty big all over Europe (particularly in Britain), and the band were keen to make inroads in their own backyard, so this album was to take on the US market - even the title seems geared to their prospective new audience, although knowing their wicked sense of humour, it was more likely just a piss take title for their seventh album! I asked Russell and Ron to spill the beans on how they ended up with it, they told me "We just felt it a propos to title our 7th album Introducing Sparks. Most bands don't name their 7th album 'introducing'. That's probably what appealed to us. In fact, most bands don't even have a 7th album!".

I first made a prototype to see if it would be appropriate.
TMT, developed over 20 years ago by social psychologists, explains how humans come to cope with death anxiety by developing self-esteem and attributing purpose to life. However, we do this by shoring up our own cultural identities, self-esteem, and frankly become more conservative in the way that we view others who might threaten our world view. So while Dark Tourism might make us feel all the better about being alive, it may make us less tolerant of others which just seems so counter-intuitive.
I used to sell property and casualty insurance down in Sarasota Florida. I remember after I got licensed I was supposed to find a target niche for my prospecting efforts and develop a marketing strategy to target businesses within that niche. I picked professional liability after some quick success in that line of business and put together a prospect list of companies who I wanted to approach about writing their insurance. There was one account that I set my eyes on and really wanted to land. It was a large multi location diagnostics facility with large property and casualty exposures that would not only result in a challenge to structure but would land me a huge commission if I could write the account.

Biologists generally agree, however that one feature above all others defines the orchid and differentiates it from virtually all other flowering plants - the fusion of the male portion of the flower (stamens) and the female portion (pistils). Orchid flowers are pollinated by a great variety of flying animals, and their diversity in floral structure has resulted from adaptations to various pollinators. About half the orchid species are pollinated by bees; moths, butterflies, flies, birds, and other agents pollinate the rest. Many orchid flowers are adapted for pollination by a single species of insect.

What a lie it is to believe that today is just going to be like every other day. It can't be with Jesus in it. His "love and life and grace and truth" are going to fill up today making sure that no "today" will be "just like yesterday." I wonder what we miss because we've stopped believing that Jesus will continue to leave us in awe and wonder, even on "just another Monday?"
Do I believe what I know to be true, even though it robs me of my hope?
What I have not found is any evidence that the motive for farm murders is "genocide". The perpetrators are sometimes caught, tried and convicted. In how many of these cases has the motive been proved to be "genocide"? If the genocide propagandists can show that this morive has been proved in the majority of cases (a 51% majority will do), then I will be prepared to take their contentions seriously. But until they do that, I will take their assertions with several bags of salt, and merely white racist propaganda. Sannie sê Sannie sal sewe sakke sout sleep.
Come to think of it, there's really no difference between Mandela and Taylor. Mandela supporters terrorized the black majority into electing him president in 1994, after South Africa had been at war against communist forces since the mid-1960's. Taylor, following a peace deal that ended the Liberian Civil War, also terrorized the population into electing him president in the 1997 general election.

Next, write down all the skills you need to learn or to work on. If you are just getting started with writing, you may find this difficult. If people have made comments on your writing, you can use those comments to make your list. If, for instance, you have been told that your characters are not believable or your descriptions fuzzy, then the skills of creating characters and writing description go on your list. Or try this: read over a piece of writing by your favorite author, writing you consider excellent. Now write down all the things the writer does that make this piece so good. How many of these things can you do now? How many of them do you need to learn how to do?

Holy shit. I had no idea how isolated we've become. We do not go out as a family. WHATSOEVER. Going out to dinner is, simply, out of the question. The likelihood of Bennett acting out, or throwing his food across the restaurant if something goes wrong, while not HIGH, is still high enough to where Jennifer and I both do not risk it.
It took all morning but we finally convinced Tali that she was two. She kept saying, "No!" but that her response to everything these days. ;) She didn't want to blow out the candles because she just wanted to dig into the cherry tomatoes. Those were the favorites and the first to disappear. Tali also ate the apples and sampled the cucumbers. Ana ate tomatoes, oranges, apples, cucumbers, and celery. She sampled the peppers. Amanda ate everything after arranging it all neatly on her plate. We didn't get to the pineapple so we'll try that at snack time.
A lot of you would say I still have a thing for her, but you would be so wrong. I am being completely serious when I say that I would rather be shot than even consider being in the same town with her ever again. Our marriage was on the rocks when she got pregnant and the two years I spent with her after the birth were like hell on earth. I was being truthful when I said I was put off from sex while watching a birth live. I was so messed up, I was worried I would even want to be with anyone's vagina after I moved out. So I am not in any hurry to find this pic and you know what? I left all those pics on her computer before I left and the thought of looking for a pic of my ex-wife's vagina with a coconut-sized object trying to push its way out thrills me to no end.
The crazy thing is that I never shared my passions, not even with my best friends. I think they may have guessed how obsessed I was with Star Wars and old movies. They had no understanding of my desire to be on stage. And I never once told them the name of the boy I had a crush on. At the time, I think I thought it was self-protection. That if my dreams didn't come true, at least no one knew about them, so I didn't have to be ashamed.
It was so cute. SOOOOO CUTE. Take a look at this photo, which I didn't want to copy here because it's copyrighted, to get an idea of the cuteness of this mouse. It was about the size of a quarter.

Singer Dionne Warwick showed that the way to San Jose isn't the only thing she's not familiar with, as she pawed in bewilderment at the cash register. Actress and deaf person Marlee Matlin conveniently forgot a lifetime of lip-reading so she could have a sign-language interpreter serve as a go-between in case anyone was tempted to yell at her. Supermodel Niki Taylor tossed pizza dough into the air, actually catching it on the way down a few times.

Here is some of the amazing things the DT have come up with for you to get some inspiration from......
Monday, February 8th was a great night. We had pizza at A Slice of Brooklyn and then we made a presentation at the 77th Precinct Community Council meeting. There were a lot of people - probably over 50. I was a little nervous because I have never done a presentation outside of school before. But, come to find out it was great and me and the other students did well.
Under both systems, sacrifice is invoked as a magic, omnipotent solution in any crisis-and "the public good" is the altar on which victims are immolated. But there are stylistic differences of emphasis. The socialist-communist axis keeps promising to achieve abundance, material comfort and security for its victims, in some indeterminate future. The fascist-Nazi axis scorns material comfort and security, and keeps extolling some undefined sort of spiritual duty, service and conquest. The socialist-communist axis offers its victims an alleged social ideal. The fascist-Nazi axis offers nothing but loose talk about some unspecified form of racial or national "greatness." The socialist-communist axis proclaims some grandiose economic plan, which keeps receding year by year. The fascist-Nazi axis merely extols leadership-leadership without purpose, program or direction-and power for power's sake.
That place is delicious. Just walking through the door puts me in a better mood.

The Royal troops aren't up to much, but are no worse than the Rebels, so don't really merit being Hordes. They use a mix of swords and shields, and polearms, so you could have some Spears if you wanted. Blades seems the best all-round classification, though. The Artillery represents various fanciful weapons employed against Pulgasari, including fireball-hurling catapults, rocket batteries and some amazingly impractical cannon. A magical priestess was also used in an attempt to defeat the monster.

Established in 1892, CILEx was known as the Institute of Legal Executives (ILEX) in 1963 before changing its name in January 2012 when it received a royal charter. According to CILEx, 81.5 per cent of its members have parents who studied at university. Only 2 per cent of members have a lawyer for a parent. Clearly, CILEx operates in different circles from the magic-circle law firms, which have attracted criticism in the past for using the old boys' network of recruitment.

It is nearly impossible to engender the necessary confidence, trust and loyalty a leader must possess without being fully engaged. A leader spends as much time out of the confines of the office engaging in real conversation with people as they do in their office planning, decision-making and organizing. Whether in person, over the phone, via email, through the social web, or even by sending a good old fashion "thank you" note - be an engaging conversationalist.

But it's not. Most school chicken nuggets have at least a zillion ingredients. Okay, I exaggerate. Maybe they have thirty-five. Modified corn starch, soy, beef extract and maltodextrin - among other things - are not something I'd want any human to have in moderation. The same goes for cupcakes. I'm not against cake, and I'm not against most traditions. Just the last two weekends I let my son sing happy birthday and consume cake. But it was my choice. I was there to be his "judgment," and he ate confections. But I also know he's not likely to eat cake for another whole year. The birthdays for the February 2010 babies from my mommy groups are all done, and so is the cake. I don't have to worry about every neighborhood parent running down to the local grocery and bringing a sugar, corn syrup and white flour treat right to his preschool desk.

Deep in to the first thirty minutes or so of the chick flick and I found myself thinking about story. Just the word and what it means. It was during the scenes in which the graduated "It" girls arrived in Abu Dhabi that my mind began to wander. You see this is where I noticed the story that had pulled me in during the first half hour shifted its focus from story telling to showiness. Somewhere, someone must have stated that the second installment of the movie must be bigger or needed more, I'll use Ms. Bradshaw's word, "sparkle" than its predecessor. Yeah I get it, in a vast sea of sequels they had to dream up some way for theirs to standout, but along the way they forgot about story. And how a well written, relatable tale can pull in and take hold of an audience every time.
When was the last time you gave your windows any attention? Last week? Last month? Last year? Its spring and a great time to have a "cleaning" challenge. This week I am challenging you to open up the drapes, pull up the blinds, and let the sunshine in! We are going to be washing the windows! Throughout the rest of April, we will be concentrating on spring cleaning during the weekly challenges. Its always more fun cleaning with others.

For those tasks that could very well carry you through the night, you need to realise that somethings are better left for the next day if they are beyond reasonable to accomplish today. You will normally find that doing so will produce a better result anyway as you will be better focused and will have had time to re-energise.

Seems to be the case that for some reason, the Left (as I'll call them here), have been brainwashed into thinking the EDL are a violent Nazi group. My experience is that it's the UAF that are against free speech, human rights and are willing to let this country go to the dogs! If you believe in democracy, why do you protest at anybody else's parade, demo or whatever?
But then something else happened. That same baby that was gifted to her from heaven, the one she felt growing and moving in her womb, the same child that gave her pleasure every time he said 'mama', fell ill and died, in her lap.
Monday was so nice. I got up later than I had on the trip, but earlier than usual for me. I lazed around all day, catching up on tv shows that I had missed while I was gone, and catching up on a few things online. It was so nice to have air conditioning, electricity, my computer, my phone, and my bed. All things that I missed on the trip.

Have a great weekend my crafty friends
We stood outside their house and hugged and prayed over them. I held each of them tight until they cried. They needed a mother's love and protection and the feel of safet, if only for a moment. I kissed them all over their faces and told them I loved them and we would see them again, and help them in the meantime. Isabelle and Johnny begged to give them all the food we had in the van, so we asked them to walk back with us. We walked down that path to the van, praying the whole way. I didn't know until later that night after looking at the pictures that we were all holding hands. Isabelle and Johnny love these girls too, and their hearts were broken and changed that day too.
No matter, my love,
It's unfair to you because you may not be aware of what you are signing up for, in which case, you may host their advertisements for free without making any money. Whether or not it's ethical to post editorial content that you may make money off of is really up for grabs at this point in the blogopshere. I personally feel uncomfortable about placing advertisements in my blog unless they are clearly marked.
The bike training that the children are doing came next, Herr B couldn't resist the opportunity to comment that some of the bikes (that'll be 2 English kids then at least) don't have kick down bike stands and have to be leant up against the wall, damn! Good job schools have walls eh? I refuse as a matter of principle to put a bike stand on Jas's bike (sorry Jas) and if next year when the local cop in charge of bike testing doesn't pass the bike because of it's lack of a stand then so be it, to date there's no legal requirement for bikes to have stands to make them roadworthy therefore our bikes will be standless and I shall stand my ground on that one.
Whether your recent bizarre policy decisions are driven by a fear of Islam or a woeful lack of Islamic understanding remains unclear, but to most impartial observers it would appear you have crossed the loyalty line and are now officially endorsing sharia law in Britain.
Come to think of it, there's really no difference between Mandela and Taylor. Mandela supporters terrorized the black majority into electing him president in 1994, after South Africa had been at war against communist forces since the mid-1960's. Taylor, following a peace deal that ended the Liberian Civil War, also terrorized the population into electing him president in the 1997 general election.

UPDATE (1): 20th December, 2011. The Irish Times has the inside track today on the Daly settlement (1) 17-20 Bond Street has indeed, according to the newspaper, been sold to LVMH for 350m (GBP 300m, chances are that the GBP 300m is correct and at current exchange rates the price tag is 358m) and (2) the Dalys have handed back 80m of assets to NAMA which had previously, reportedly, been transferred by the Dalys outside the ownership of the specific borrowers and (3) the 80m handed back includes 17m in cash which was reportedly transferred by David Daly to his wife, Mary. The Irish Times reports that the settlement means " NAMA has recovered the 457 million debt owed by Mr Daly and his family" but that statement presupposes the assets recovered by NAMA are worth the difference between the 457m face value of the loans and the 350m-odd proceeds from the 17-20 Bond Street sale to LVMH. However, this is beginning to look like a solid success for NAMA if (a) it has recovered the face value of loans which it bought at a discount from AIB and (b) NAMA didn't lose the Daly challenge about consultation and (c) NAMA is not stuck with what are likely to be substantial legal costs - on this last point we should find out in January 2012 what is happening to costs.

TSUNAMI WARNING IT ISSUED FOR ANOTHER PART OF THE PACIFIC. BASED
A few years ago I discovered 'osteopathic manipulative treatment' (OMT) and the pain in my knee mysteriously disappeared. But by then I was fully in the throes of motherhood and exercise had been off the table for so long that I didn't know how to get it back into my life. I still don't really know how I will accomplish this task, I just know that I must. I need an exercise montage. I need abdominal muscles.
Audrey subsequently suffered a heart attack, brought on in part by the stress of dealing with her feud with David over the ownership of what was formerly her hair salon. She had earlier signed over her interest in the salon to David, as she intended to elope with Lewis Archer (Nigel Havers) and to buy a hotel in Greece. She now wants the salon back.

You know, even though the use of the media in this book was slightly exaggerated, it is true, people of our age have no other source of information. All we know about the wars, the natural disasters, and etc. we know from media. The media does have the power to motivate, demotivate, and form the opinion of the people.

The tan color deepened to brown and spread around me. To my astonishment, the area of color developed, like a photo, into a vision of a man with chocolate-brown skin. He superimposed himself over the left side of my face and upper chest and my left arm, and I perceived him as if from the inside and the outside at the same time. I could actually see him, with technicolor clarity, something that had never, ever happened to me before. He looked to be in his mid-thirties, with very round cheeks and prominent eyes, a little like Louis Armstrong. I heard the name "Bertram."

Step 2 - Drop and Bake: Drop batter by tablespoon onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in a well pre-heated 350º F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Do not over-bake. Cookies should be a bit gooey in the center. While warm, they will be very soft on the outside, as well. Allow them to cool on the pan a few minutes and then transfer carefully to a rack to finish cooling. (They will always be somewhat soft because these are gooey fudge brownie cookies, not hard or crunchy cookies.)

Note: don't expect the dough to rise during this period - remember, it's not a yeast bread, and by definition unleavened ('chappa' means flattened in Tamil). I assumed this was more of a "rest" period for the gluten and what not in the flours to react with the water. Other chapati recipes online, however, don't include the hour rest period, so if you're in a rush I'm tempted to say you could skip it.
Here's the Great Audrey. The pageant tiara or more commonly known Holly Golightly pictured below, is the tiara we associate with brides today.

Or will she do more important things?
As someone with Type 1 diabetes (the "real" diabetes, as I like to put it -- the kind you can't help getting), I sometimes wonder when I'll end up retiring, or how long I can escape death. So I wonder how much I should be saving for retirement. Will I get the typical 25-30 year long retirement? Or would I have to retire at 40 to pull that one off? If I work until I'm 65, I could have lots put away, only to die within 2 years if I'm lucky, on the other hand.
It was a heavyweight week. The kind that I'll notice, and chide myself for, every time I pull my jeans on next week.

The Rally Fighter was prototyped in the workshop at the back of the Wareham office, but manufacturing muscle also came from Factory Five Racing, a kit-car company and Local Motors investor located just down the road. Of course, the kit-car business has been around for decades, standing as a proof of concept for how small manufacturing can work in the car industry. Kit cars combine hand-welded steel tube chassis and fiberglass bodies with stock engines and accessories. Amateurs assemble the cars at their homes, which exempts the vehicles from many regulatory restrictions (similar to home-built experimental aircraft). Factory Five has sold about 8,000 kits to date.

Besides, isn't state-ism itself a religion for most Americans? Do they not honor the state above all else, above even the commandments of a conventional religion they may embrace? If their religion tells them "thou shalt not murder," but the state orders them to murder, then they murder. If the state tells them to rob, to destroy property, and to imprison innocent people, then, notwithstanding any religious strictures, they rob, destroy property, and imprison innocent people, as millions of victims of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and millions of victims of the so-called Drug War in this country will attest. Moreover, in every form of adversity, Americans look to the state for their personal salvation, just as before the twentieth century their ancestors looked to Divine Providence.
Reaching goals requires motivation. ZenHabits does a nice job of explaining motivation, as well as ways to achieve it and sustain it during times of struggle. To find out more about motivation, check out the self-motivation quiz from Mindtools. After the quiz, there is a nice explanation of factors involved in self-motivation including: self-confidence and efficacy, positive thinking, focus, and environment. The author from the article How Self-Motivated Are You noted, "Self-motivation doesn't come naturally to everyone. And even those who are highly self-motivated need some extra help every now and then. Build your self-motivation by practicing goal-setting skills, and combining those with positive thinking, the creation of powerful visions of success, and the building of high levels of self-efficacy and self-confidence."

The point here is surely not to deride empiricism. Heaven knows conservatism could stand to quit leading with its heart and start thinking more empirically about the world as it is, not the world as they wish it to be. The point, if I'm reading them correctly, is that too many leading voices on the left give themselves over to wonkiness, and presume that their moral convictions are widely shared, such that the only reason anybody could disagree with them is through ignorance (willful or not), or malice.
The ideas employed in foul play are given a false foundation but one that is seemingly real. They depend on the person to whom they present the ideas to mistake the reality. Thus the targeted person believes their somatic reactivity is evidence that the idea is real. And this is generally true. If we sense danger for instance, even though we don't have sensory information our body will move to fear because that is natural. It is the preparation of our body to face and deal with the danger. In foul play the danger card is play to cause the targeted person to mistakenly believe that the presented idea, of which they are more conscious, has led to their somatic arousal. This empowers the ideas. In reality the danger posed and the idea presented are unrelated. It is through trickery that the person targeted is brought along to believing in the ideas presented. And you will see that with certainty when you are no longer unsuspecting of the foul play having done the experiments and having seen how easily you can be manipulated while believing the medical misinformation. And that includes the psychiatric babble about misreading others if you are suspicious. What they are effectively saying is that you have to accept appearances at face value. That's self-serving garbage. When you have done the experiments and "wised up" or "level up" to use PC game parlance, then the foul game can't be played as to obtain a result. You can "walk through the valley of the shadow of death and fear no evil"! A knowledgeable person can stand against the evil mobs and win. I am living proof of that but you need to see that for yourselves. It is good for you to be sceptical of what I am presenting but please also be curious. This is not about some academic pursuit; this is a life and death matter. To be empowered and reap the benefits for yourselves you must realize the truth and not just know it.

I wanted to like The Final Countdown a lot more than I did. This is one script, however, that ends up just as a drama, with a couple of intriguing scenes involving aerial recon pictures and historic pictures, and another scene where that captured Japanese pilot suddenly realizes what is going on. It was so close, so often. And the very last scene with the black limo WAS clever, but you expect that at the end of an episode of "Twilight Zone". You expect MORE from all this and World War II.

Admiral Ororod did not garner the complete respect of those under him; he had connections, came from a well-to-do family with important political ties, more a bureaucrat with aspirations for a political career than a military career, he ran his detachment more like a business than the military unit it was. He may have been far from the most inspirational of fleet officers, but his politically minded motivations also helped to ensure that the Orion was one of the top training vessels in all the fleet.

The truth is, in spite of its colonial history, the Dutch don't do hierarchy - and no more so in business than socially. The Dutch mind-set is not altogether different to Ireland - staunchly strong on family and community - steeped in a history of culture and an attitude that anything can be achieved no matter what the adversity. If we differ in Ireland - it's because we love to feast on adversity and the bad weather and it creates a poetic and spiritual solace, rather than an ability to always move forward and turn what we hold dear into triumph. In the Netherlands, there is no fear of a lack of attachment or going it alone - no matter how small or great the aspiration.
It's interesting to see what dates a television show, at the time you might have guessed the clothes, or the cars maybe. Probably not the cigarettes.

I followed my parent's home, even though they weren't aware of my presense. My mom wept all the way while my dad remained silent. He begged my mom to calm down but it all fell on deaf ears. We got home to find the house filled with friends and relatives, my Dad carried my body and laid it on the mat in the living room. Prayers for forgiveness were said, and my parents were advised to stop crying as it wouldn't bring me back. I watched my Mom cry and weep all night as she asked God why He Had to take my life.

I also feel a change coming in me. I prefer to stay at home, or go for a quiet dinner, or watch a movie. I don't like clubbing anymore, or going and getting "wasted" which is what most of my friends do. Nothing wrong with that at all. But I am just not there anymore. My idea of a good night out now is relaxing at home with a good movie, or going to a cinema, or cooking dinner, or going out to eat. If alcohol must be involved, a nice quiet bar where we can sit and talk.
SkyWest's total operating revenues increased $55.2 million, or 6.4%, during the quarter ended March 31, 2012, over the same period in 2011. The increase in operating revenues was the result of higher pass-through costs (primarily fuel and engine overhaul costs) under SkyWest's agreements with its major partners and an increase in block hour production. The increase in operating revenues was offset by a planned reduction in prorate flying block hours of 13.4% resulting in reduced revenues of approximately $6.0 million. In spite of the reducing operating revenues from prorate flying, SkyWest's revenue per available seat mile for this flying increased 14.6% from improved pricing. After excluding the increased pass-through costs of approximately $31.1 million, for fuel and engine overhauls, and the reduction in prorate flying revenue of $6.0, total operating revenues increased approximately $30.1 million due to the additional block hour production of 3.1% and improved utilization. Total block hours for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 were 556,421 compared to 539,910 for the same period last year.

Once you have your paper cut out in the size you want, I generally use my Xacto knife to score my folds (very gently, I really don't even push, just drag the blade gently across the paper). I score the "pretty side" of my paper, not the back. A ruler helps to keep your lines straight, if you don't trust yourself scoring the paper, you can also line up your ruler and fold against it to keep your folds crisp.

That's it. There aren't really any short cuts. People always want short cuts. New acts often want to know how to get an agent. The chances are that any act asking how to get an agent doesn't really need an agent. And when they're at a stage where an agent can help them, they'll find there are agents there offering to help. That's how it works.
You guys ever hear of the Binger, Bing Crosby? He's like Dean Martin, except not drunk all the time and--as far as I know--doesn't try to drug some young woman into a "white Christmas" and his "holiday inn", if you know what I'm saying. If you don't, well, you need to catch up on your classic Christmas movies. Commie. Also, what the hell? Barenaked Ladies made one helluva Christmas album a few years ago, with new songs and traditional. And it's awesome. Try throwing that in every once in a while instead of another rendition of Frosty the Snowman.

So I am not in any hurry to find this pic and you know what? I left all those pics on her computer before I left and the thought of looking for a pic of my ex-wife's vagina with a coconut-sized object trying to push its way out thrills me to no end.
What if they were to do a study to report a finding of clinically obese people who'd take a year or more off their lives for a "perfect" body? Or people with some sort of birth defect? Or - and perhaps most pertinent to my own situation - transsexuals?

We celebrated our 20 year anniversary by renewing our vows on a beautiful beach in La Jolla, California. We were already going to be in California for vacation and I'd always wanted a beach wedding so it seemed like the perfect time. I just wanted to have our two girls and us in attendance (and we didn't even tell anyone back at home). I arranged it all through the internet, finding an officiant who also did these beautiful flowers for me and my girls. She also helped me with finding a location. We were staying at the Lodge at Torrey Pines and she suggested the state beach right down the road from the hotel.

There was that time I watched my father in a televised drama where he was portraying yet another down and out character. There was a part where he was cold and shivering and sad, and I am told I came out from under the dining table that was my favourite hiding spot and offered my blankie to the television set saying "Here daddy, you can have my blankie, you don't have to be cold!" The adults thought that was the sweetest, funniest thing ever, but to my four year old mind, my father was suffering and I wanted to help. I knew he was pretending, but could I be really, really sure he wasn't actually cold?

Tennessee invoked the rule for the 1975 season, during the time when the maximum number of scheduled games was eleven. That season, the Vols traveled to Honolulu for their 12th scheduled game, winning 28-6. There were four non-conference games at home on the schedule that season - Maryland, North Texas State, Colorado State, and Utah - with a fifth on the road (UCLA). I don't know which of those four home NC games was the extra one added due to the Hawaii game. I hope it wasn't North Texas State - the worst Volunteer loss I personally ever witnessed.

And by the laughter, I surmise that she could tell without me letting her in on the secret. Apparently, besides my accent deepening into obscurity, I raised my voice several decibels and reverted to my Ghanenglish grammar peppered with Dagbani, something that is significantly different from the speech my Canadian-raised family is used to. And now I'm laughing and blushing, and internally cringing because I feel proud to retain vestiges of my Ghanaian communication skills, but wondering how to balance this maintenance of my slightly shifted identity while re-learning how to connect with Canadians. Especially because I need to sound polished and professional at my upcoming interviews for medicine.

Without his hearing aids in, David was oblivious to the chirps. I was a bit jealous that he could continue to sleep, while I hovered between a feeling of exhaustion, which cried out for just one more hours' sleep, and irritation at that infernal metronomic chirping.

We've done a load of work at the White Horse previously (see Rounds 1, 2, 3, 4) but we were asked back to go over a wall that we've done previously (that was looking a little grubby due to the addition of some low-grade graffiti), freshen up the gents toilet door, take care of a tall wall beside the bar and also throw in a few little extras scattered around the place. The White Horse is one of our favourite local boozers so working there is always good fun and design-wise we've obviously run with the whole White Horse identity but given it a little id-iom twist.

So if you've been following the rollercoaster ride of GSC Game World and their follow up PC title, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 then I'm afraid after a long battle, things have fallen apart for this developer. It was confirmed yesterday that the anticipated sequel has been cancelled and the studio itself shut down.
Dad went for a walk around when we got there and mum and i got the boys into their swimmers. Then Jordy was straight in the river and wanting to go floating off downstream. Mum had Darcy and i was still getting ready to get in and Jordy is off! Little bugger. I was a bit worried about him going over the edge of the waterfall but i met him down the end and he kicked over to me. Not that it was a big waterfall! He would not have been hurt if he went over but he might have scared himself.

There was a problem with Shirley's printer which held up the order slightly and so she was extremely kind and sent me this other Love design as a special surprise, and it's now brightening up the side of my wardrobe.

Let me tell you, I previously loved Gerard Butler's Phantom but Ramin Karimloo's Phantom made me want to hop through my television set, kick Christine out of the picture and run away with him on the streets of Paris. He was AMAZING with a gorgeous voice and so much raw, sexy emotion. Despite kicking her to the side for the Phantom the gorgeous Sierra Boggess was an awesome Christine with an amazingly hypnotic voice. The height of the play where they sang the theme song was filled with such romance and emotion. I also fell in love with the Music of the Night from Ramin's emotionally raw and sexy voice. I had to grab the soundtrack after to relive the experience over and over again. I simply fell in love with the production!

I first saw this H&M snake-embossed envelope clutch weeks ago at a location in the city, fell in love (who would've thought since I hate snakes?!), but passed because I didn't have my 20% coupon with me.

I was about to give up when I recently revisited one of the stores and saw they had restocked. Hallelujah!

But ending her relationship with the bikini company did not make Farrow any less dangerous. Her near-nakedness remained on display in places like Penthouse Magazine, FHM Magazine, and numerous other places who trade on the twisted ways of immodest women and play with the safety of the world on a regular basis. And as the years went by, Farrow started adding more tattoos to her body, making her not only an immodest women, but an immodest women who violated divine commandments by marking her body! There can be little question that she can be held responsible for the 2008 Sichuan earthquake that killed over 68,000 people in China.
it just stands out as a "better than what i feel i am capable of" type of photo. but i have to say... i got lucky. i mean, look at my subject! she is like a goddess. the expression on her face was completely her doing. i in no way directed her to look so expressive and perfectly frozen in time. so peaceful. so beautiful. so, i know i am just lucky. still... i pushed the shutter button at the precise moment to capture this image, so i have to give myself at least a little credit. and thus, i can not help but make this my favorite photo.
First of all, for those who don't know I have 3 adopted siblings. They are all from the Philippines. Actually there are six kids in my family and our order goes a bit like this - biological, adopted, biological, adopted, biological, adopted. :) My parents were also foster parents for about 8 years, so we had infants in and out of our house - most in which (I think) were adopted. So as you can tell adoption has been a pretty big part of my life. I always knew I wanted to adopt. It just seemed like something I was suppose to do when having a family. My husband's family is a bit different from mine - he's the only one! Although we came from different types of families, we both knew we wanted to have a family eventually.

After all, this is no ordinary "comeback". This is a man that was among the best high school sprinters/hurdlers in the country (10.36/13.66) when he graduated in 2000 (= #4 in both events). He then went to the University of Tennessee where he won back to back NCAA sprint doubles as a frosh/soph and set a National Collegiate Record for 200 meters (19.86). He then went pro and following injury in his first pro season came back to win the Olympic 100 meter title in Athens (9.85) and then a sprint double in Helsinki (9.88/20.00) in very inclement weather. The follow up was an equaling of the then WR of 9.77 for 100 meters early the next season.
Covey amplifies his message by means of wide-ranging examples of "third alternative thinkers". There's the local police force that transformed a crime-plagued community by casting off its entrenched "them against us" mentality. Another example tells the tale of a father who, during the course of one extraordinary evening, rescued his daughter from years of clinical depression. Then there's the judge who brought a swift and peaceful end to a massive environmental lawsuit without setting foot in a courtroom.

That the lives of these old fellows we see on television, and whose names we now know, go back more than a century, touches us - and it may add to the power they project for us that they are not especially heroic and do not represent themselves that way. That they do not posture or make use of any of the rhetorical cliches, but are modest survivors of the ordinary circumstances and perils of living. And that on television, where glamorisation is almost a given, so that any claim they might once have had to youthful beauty is simply irrelevant. Very young people, I suspect, who find themselves living in a dangerous and chaotic world, and with their own lives fearfully before them, feel a special affection for these old fellows who have indestructibily battled through - and even a small sense of reassurance ...
I'm sure that many times, if not most of the time, she was at least partially asleep for many of the thrashing episodes, but just not resting. She has had several nights of strange waking that's not really waking. She sometimes sits up, even says something, then collapses again with a snore. A couple times I put her on the changing table to do some saline drops in the nose, she would count the drops like she always does ("1, 2, 3, 4 drops" "other side"), but then she would instantly be quiet, and her breathing maintained the deep rhythm, even though it was labored. Then in 5 seconds, startling again. So weird.

Once you have your paper cut out in the size you want, I generally use my Xacto knife to score my folds (very gently, I really don't even push, just drag the blade gently across the paper). I score the "pretty side" of my paper, not the back. A ruler helps to keep your lines straight, if you don't trust yourself scoring the paper, you can also line up your ruler and fold against it to keep your folds crisp.

So end our readers' tributes to Hitch. As I expect many of you have been doing, I've spent quite a few hours over the last two weeks watching videos of Christopher in debate, giving talks, or taking down pompous talking heads on television. I could recommend my favorites, but suggest instead that you just find a random one and follow the YouTube links. You will be impressed: for someone who talked so often, he rarely repeated himself, and everything he said sounded fresh. We have nobody to replace this man, but, thank Ceiling Cat, he left us a legacy of not only his writings and the example of his courage, but also the visual record of his eloquence and incessant fight for the truth.

The chicken arrived already quartered; there was a huge plate of chips and just for healthy balance a huge plate of salad. The chicken was cooked to perfection with an unknown (to us) variety of spices. The chips were perfectly browned and even the salad was a good mix. (Usually here they overdo the onion and under do the lettuce). All this was washed down with a fine Malbec.

I went to the front desk and explained what happened and luckily they did give us a room (it would have been a long trip home!). We got the same type of room, same rate, but it was a handicapped accessible room. They probably hold those rooms back in case they are needed. I don't know yet if I got charged for our missed night. I had reserved the room with a card that I subsequently canceled (due to fraud). So I don't know if they would have been able to charge it or not.
The story revolves around Vyme a mechanic at the star pit where ships are repaired. He tries to help out young people that want to work in the repair shops. One is Ratit. It seems Vyme misses his own group family and his kids. He has a drinking problem and that alienated him from everyone.
We'd decided on going to the Cartoon Museum in London when we read about an exhibition of work by one of the greatest cartoonists of all time, H.M. Bateman. He was the man who pioneered short or no-caption drawings which were such a welcome contrast to the rather heavily laboured pieces favoured by the Edwardians and Victorians. He also did fabulous caricatures, but was best known for his series about 'The Man Who.', which included toe-curling embarrassing moments, such as a guardsman who dropped his rifle on parade and a junior officer who ate the colonel's starter at a regimental dinner. He did superb irate older men with popping monocles and incandescent eye-brows. We both laughed outright many times in the exhibition - and nobody went Shhhhh. It's a great place: very cheap to get in, an excellent shop and the show itself was superb: very well-lit and arranged and with full, detailed captions. I can report that the Cartoon Museum hasn't caught the almost universal disease of British museums who seem to think their visitors are either ill-informed half-wits, or pre-school children.

This is an important distinction. Where early web technologies enabled people to communicate primarily with friends and family, today's networks encourage discovery and new relationships. Twitter, for instance, helps people find others who share their interests and begin conversations with them. By using hashtags, Twitter's simple indexing tool, college students can connect with thought leaders and fellow students, expanding their intellectual circles beyond the reach of their classrooms and campuses.

Established in 1892, CILEx was known as the Institute of Legal Executives (ILEX) in 1963 before changing its name in January 2012 when it received a royal charter. According to CILEx, 81.5 per cent of its members have parents who studied at university. Only 2 per cent of members have a lawyer for a parent. Clearly, CILEx operates in different circles from the magic-circle law firms, which have attracted criticism in the past for using the old boys' network of recruitment.

Anyway its late and I'm off to get sorted for tomorrow
Hmm where do I start from? where? where? where.? Oh yeah, there!. So I'm quite certain that every believer knows what "New Creation" means (at least I hope so). When asked to define the term, words like "born-again", "salvation", "repentance", "baptism" etc are bound to be used in the definition. That's all good but who really is the "NEW CREATURE"? The creation story helped me understand this better so let's start from there. Once upon a time, God created man (and woman), gave him authority over everything on earth (Genesis 1:27-31) and placed him in the Garden of Eden where man could be close to HIM (GOD) all the time. One day, the enemy of God (and all God's children), satan, tricked man into sinning against God. Satan gave man "sin and the pleasures that come with it" and in return man gave up his authority over earth and everything in it, hence, man came under the rulership of satan. Uhmm.. yeah I guess you can call it an exchange. satan brought sin to man and man paid with his authority over the earth. A poor exchange indeed.but hey, it was no robbery. Anyway, satan, having all the authority now, become the ruler of man; and man the slave of satan (Jesus replied, "Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin" John 8:32). Man was forever doomed as a slave of the enemy and like anyone who is sentenced to life imprisonment without appeal, the only way of escape is DEATH. Scary huh? I know! Well, God who created man and loved man in spite of man's disobedience wanted to free His creation from bondage so He had to send no one else but LIFE to set man free. The Son of God, JESUS CHRIST is LIFE (Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the LIFE.John 14:6; "In him was LIFE.John 1:4). JESUS was/is the only ONE who can set man free.WHY? Think of it this way. Man's only hope of escaping the slavery of satan is death and we all know everyone dies but once. You have one chance to live and after that, there is death and judgement etc. God couldn't watch man die in his sins so there had to be another way to set man free and that way is JESUS. Jesus came on the earth as a man, suffered and died.but uh huh, that's the best part. He died not just for dying sake but He died so He could defeat DEATH. He had to defeat death so He could give man a second chance to life. For 3 days He was dead but on the 3rd day, He rose again having won POWER over death."..Whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have EVERLASTING life" John 3:16. Everlasting life is possible in Jesus because He holds both the power of LIFE (because He is LIFE) and DEATH(because He defeated death) in His hands. Any man who then believes in Him is set free from slavery through death but is given another chance to live and is given a NEW LIFE. Jesus creates the old slave who died anew and breathes LIFE again into his nostrils to make him a living soul.(Then the LORD God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being: Genesis 2:7). This is why anyone who is born-again/born in Christ is said to be a NEW CREATURE (Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new: 2 Corinthians 5:17). Just like the first man ever created, the NEW CREATURE is not placed back on in the world he just got freed from, he is placed into a world, a place, a kingdom where he can be close to God again. The NEW CREATURE no longer belongs to the world of sin and slavery (.because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you- John 15:19). The blessings and authority (Gen. 1:28-31) man God first gave to man before the fall is returned to the NEW CREATURE who becomes part of the body of Christ (.and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all- Ephe. 1:20-23). Yup! Not only does the NEW YOU receive freedom and salvation in CHRIST, but you also receive power and authority over satan and his followers. So now you know.The "NEW YOU" who is born in CHRIST is more powerful and more important than can be comprehended. YOU are God's own precious POSSESSION bought at a very high price. YOU are PRICELESS as could be. Turn to HIS WORD to fully know the "NEW YOU" He created.

The key to this entire problem was failure to understand Paul's ministry and message. Were Lysius to side with the Jews, he would be as lost as they. Fortunately, he had Paul in a semi-private audience. The Jews no longer had a gospel message for God was no longer dealing with them. To Paul was given the gospel of the grace of God for so we read in Ephesians 3:2.

Watching my children and the aspirations that they have got me thinking. When do children stop aspiring to be heros? Ask any boy what he wants to be when he grows up and you're likely to be answered with things like firefighter, police officer, super hero, doctor. I've yet to meet a child who dreamed of being an accountant, lawyer, or sanitation engineer(though to be fair, my kids get really excited when the garbage truck comes rolling past our house). There is nothing wrong with any of the professions I've just mentioned, and I think they're all equally important. Perhaps we feel as we grow older that if we can't be super heros, then why bother trying? That, and being a super hero isn't a real job. A number of people are quite keen to pitch in around the community, or help someone on the side of the highway with a flat tire. We generally stop actively looking for people to help though.

Needless to say, we didn't run classes that week, but it was interesting to see the areas where we would usually hold yoga classes being used instead for BBQs, and the relaxing quiet poolside area being turned into the local evening rum club! Still, the energy was upbeat and positive and all added to the fantastic vibes already there.
Now that a few days have passed, I look back on that Chrysalis weekend with such joy. I don't think about the logistics of it all, I think about how present God was throughout it. With God's help, that weekend was flawless. And as I sat on Sunday listening to these girls talk about how positively affected they were by this weekend.. I knew at that very instant that every bit of sweat and tears was worth it.

it just stands out as a "better than what i feel i am capable of" type of photo. but i have to say... i got lucky. i mean, look at my subject! she is like a goddess. the expression on her face was completely her doing. i in no way directed her to look so expressive and perfectly frozen in time. so peaceful. so beautiful. so, i know i am just lucky. still... i pushed the shutter button at the precise moment to capture this image, so i have to give myself at least a little credit. and thus, i can not help but make this my favorite photo.
From the other lane, coming towards us, we begin to see the cause of the hold-up. Marching towards us in crisp precision was a phalanx of police officers. No ordinary officers these as they were clad in riot gear complete with helmets and shields. They were surrounding about forty protesters and they were all making their way south.
Looks like Arizona's immigration laws worked: Violent crime is down 2-3 times the national average, among other benefits. Too bad the Democrats are trying to find more ways to buy votes from illegal aliens.

After passing a few awful sicknesses back and forth we are ready for spring more than ever! Today was chilly but the sun was shining and the birds were chirping...so it's coming. This past weekend I put the remainder of the "winter" decorations away and made room for a couple new springy plants.

THE WHITE HOUSE
Having just been exposed to tombs, mummies and the world of Hatshepsut full-throttle in a middle school text book, it seemed more fitting than ever to face the crowds and potential chaos with three kids ages 6 - 11, all in the name of seeing the real thing. And, with no more strollers or diapers to consider, it was well worth the attempt.
'''He spoke of how modern architecture is international not culture-specific and that it is big concerns that commission large projects. They are in the service of commerce.'''
* The low ASA of the collodion pretty much forces a portrait exposure to be between two seconds and six seconds. This, to me, forces a very distinct similarity of portraiture, no matter the photographer.
For me it didn't get bad until after the D&C. I suppose I assumed that it would be the same this time. But then I have to remind myself that it was almost as if I had 3 weeks to deal with the shock of it all before I actually "lost" my baby. This time I knew that I couldn't deal with the emotional turmoil associated with waiting for things to happen naturally as my body obviously has a very difficult time letting go. I gave myself one day to let in soak in, to say goodbye to my sweet child, and then took Cytotec again (which this time didn't even make me bleed at all) and had the D&C on Thursday.
Teaching, because I'm a teacher. Writing, because most writers have to rant about the process at one point or another. Food, because, I like to eat, cook and have plenty of opinions about restaurants. Movies and theater and museums. My family.
I love my expedit units and they hold a lot but I need a lot more than that! If you look at the pictures, I have stuff on the floor, on the counters and my desk, I can barely walk around! There is some unused space in the closet I just need to figure out how to use it...shelves, bookshelf,a special built... I am not sure yet...a little help??
Another one that has crept up in the last 2-3 years is where I can be, physically and literally exist and take up Jaime-shaped space, based on the weather. If it's a day I'm working from home and it's sunny, I cannot be in my house. I pace around hugging the cat and feeling "off" and unproductive even if I'm getting work done.
The weather's been beautiful this past week: blue skies, sunshine, rising temperatures. It's even been warm enough to eat lunch outside. It's really hard to believe that last year at this time, we still had a bit of snow. Of course, the cold can come back anytime, but for now, it's the most beautiful spring weather.

But this movie is not made for people like me. It is made for a different demographic, which is fine. I knew it going in, but I had heard enough to suggest it would have, like, cross-subcultural appeal. It did not. I would almost rather watch a regular romcom/dramedy or whatever this was because at least it isn't trying to pretend it's all that different from the mainstream.
Never anything that suggests an actual meeting took place and the writer certainly didn't take the photo.

For those who don't know much about salsa, it translates to "sauce" and its origins trace back as far as the Aztec civilization! Thanks to it's fresh and healthy ingredients, salsa replaced ketchup as the top selling condiment in North America in 1997.
The aroma was filled with the recognizable smell of Smith and Cross: strong, funky and full of promise. Of course the molasses was there as well, though I am still not sure if I was smelling the actual molasses or the Smith and Cross. Also, the pineapple spear, which was an utter garnish failure, awkward protuberance that it was, added a bit of undefinable fruitiness to the nose. The first sip was very molasses-y, though the hogo of the rum carried through at the end. You would think that there would be some sweetness in this drink, but it was dry and earthy, with a vague powdery texture that made each sip seem almost chewy. After I increased the bitters, the spices became more detectable on the swallow. The flavors of the molasses were also enhanced by the increase in bitters--the drink seemed sweeter, in that pleasing molasses cookie way, and the flavors in general seemed more balanced. Overall, not bad but not great.
At two my son was a bruiser. He was more prone to hit you up side the head with a Tonka truck than he was to stroke your cheek. He knew nothing of what it was to "miss" someone and he had been with me all day so there would be no reason to say it, even if he knew what it meant. He was happy when I took him to the crib and happy to lay down for his nap so there was no reason for his chin to tremble with emotion. From that moment on I've had a peace in my heart with the knowledge that our loved ones don't really leave us, they just leave the vehicle we recognize. That was possibly one of the greatest gifts my mother ever gave to me! Thanks Mom!
But the board to play with the audited casino bonus codes here, does not lose relevance. Large casino (or rather, finance companies, serving them) use a much more serious protection of players (up to store data on servers not connected to the Internet). In addition, there is a risk to get to the casino, which opened specially to collect credit card numbers and money trusting players and disappear.

My memoir on adopting my daughter from China was perhaps the hardest thing I ever wrote mainly because at the same time that I was trying to understand what was going on, what this sudden unexpected journey in the middle of my life actually meant, to capture in words what it actually felt like- I was trying to get others to understand, to feel all of this at the same time.

Tennessee invoked the rule for the 1975 season, during the time when the maximum number of scheduled games was eleven. That season, the Vols traveled to Honolulu for their 12th scheduled game, winning 28-6. There were four non-conference games at home on the schedule that season - Maryland, North Texas State, Colorado State, and Utah - with a fifth on the road (UCLA). I don't know which of those four home NC games was the extra one added due to the Hawaii game. I hope it wasn't North Texas State - the worst Volunteer loss I personally ever witnessed.

I started with Indus, an IPA. It looked to be pouring a bit flat and it took a bit of coaxing to get a loose-bubbled head to form on the top. It didn't last long. However the beer really benefits from the low carbonation as it creates a wonderful cask-like effect, with just enough sparkle to push the flavours out. Naturally enough, it's hops out front: good honest English varieties by the taste of them, with lots of floral orange blossom laid on quite intensely, creating almost a resinous burn while staying clean and crisp, avoding all harshness. At 4.6% ABV it's around a percentage point weaker than the likes of White Shield and Bengal Lancer, but I'd regard it as being very much in the same league. The balance of marmalade and toffee you get in the others isn't present here, but the hop punchiness makes up for it for me. Tangy, sinkable and with a lasting bitterness, I really enjoyed it.

While Nicholas tries to figure away to rescue Sacha's head from a life of ghoulish servitude, the Baron and Otto are down in the lab trying get their walking corpses to mate with one another. Repeatedly instructing his female zombie to kiss his male zombie, the Baron grows increasingly frustrated by the male zombie's lack of arousal after each command to "kiss him" fails to bare any erectile fruit. Unaware that Sacha's brain is not wired for sex, the Baron starts to loose it. Blaming everything from the blood they used to outside agitators, the Baron is determined to get his zombies to procreate, as it's his dream to create a race of superior beings with Serbian noses.

Drifting refers to a driving technique and to a motorsport where the driver intentionally over steers, causing loss of traction in the rear wheels through turns, while maintaining vehicle control and a high exit speed. A car is drifting when the rear slip angle is greater than the front slip angle prior to the corner apex, and the front wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or vice versa), and the driver is controlling these factors. As a motor sport, professional drifting competitions are held worldwide. Drift challenges drivers to navigate a course in a sustained sideslip by exploiting coupled nonlinearities in the tire force response.

Now, I don't want to sound like I'm crapping on the whole movie, because I actually did enjoy it. I think they did some perfect casting with Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades. They are two of my favorite actors, and I can't think of any two people more perfect for those two roles. I also have a huge crush on the ruggedly handsome Sam Worthington, and Mads Mikkelson is pretty much great in everything he does, and this is no exception. My favorite part of the movie was the whole Medusa scene. From Io explaining the Medusa backstory to Perseus cutting off her head, it is amazing! Its nuts because they all survive these giant ass scorpions, and the three witches (also a cool scene.."a sacrifice!"), but they all drop like flies when it comes to Medusa. She doesn't even have to do anything. She looks at you...you die. End of story.

Schirmbeck on Wednesday filed a formal complaint over the matter with Galveston County District Attorney Jack Roady.

In November, residents will have a chance to vote on whether to continue the photo ticketing program. Schirmbeck believes the slick video material was produced by Redflex, but the commercials did not disclose their true origin, in violation of state campaign laws.

So Shelly is the story of three friends, all modern-day high school students, based on the lives and personalities of the second generation of English Romantic poets: Gordon, Lord Byron; Percy Bysshe Shelley; and John Keats. After Shelly dies in what's ruled a "sailing accident," the other two steal the urn containing her ashes from her wake and attempt to fulfill her final wish to have them scattered on the very beach where her body washed ashore. In the process of completing their quest, Keats, as narrator, reveals the story of the trinity's pasts, together and apart.

It has also been suggested that local communities should be given the right to buy up closed pubs and run them themselves. This may work in close-knit villages in the Lake District, but it's unlikely to be of much interest to the neighbours of large urban pubs like the Four Heatons or the Southern Hotel. The most likely result if some kind of "cooling off period" is introduced for people to try to raise the money to buy them is pubs remaining closed and blighted for months with no realistic prospect of ever coming back to life. In general, local communities are more likely to want developers to get on with it and build a block of flats or a supermarket as soon as possible.

3. (C) After thanking PM Meles for the meeting and noting the positive U.S.-Ethiopian relationship, Sen. Feingold asked the PM about Ethiopian plans for dealing with Somalia. Meles replied that the situation in Somalia had deteriorated significantly in the last six months. Like the Taliban in Afghanistan, the CIC had filled a political vacuum in Somalia, providing security and stability in areas that they controlled. Meles said the CIC was also riding a wave of resurgent Jihadism in the region which had been encouraged by developments in Iraq and Afghanistan. He noted that the CIC had been implementing the same brand of radical Islam espoused by other extremists, as was evidenced by their censoring of television programming and cinemas, as well as their ban on khat. Meles acknowledged that Somalis had traditionally resisted such extreme interpretations of Islam, but also remarked that Somalis "liked to back a winning horse" and Jihadists had accumulated a string of victories that was winning converts to their cause. This gathering military momentum had allowed a relatively small group of extremists to dominate the large and diverse organizations who formed the CIC. Meles said CIC leaders Sheik Aweys, Aidan Ayro and Hassan al-Turki had direct connections to Al Qaeda that were known to intelligence services, including in the U.S. He agreed with Sen. Feingold's suggestion that the CIC could be considered a "franchise of Al Qaeda."

Not everyone is a fan of Valentine's Day, and although I'm one of those as well, I just want to be clear that unlike my last book, Fractured Facade, this short story is not about me. Well, some "elements" of the tale are based on true life experiences, but not necessarily mine.

If there was an award for courage in the cricketing world, it should very well be named after Bob Willis. When he was 26, he had operations on both his knees, which meant he was in constant pain whenever he played. In fact, on certain days, he needed to run five miles in order to generate the strength to play. It was only through his will that Willis managed to play and succeed at the top level for nine more years. At 6 feet 6 inches, Willis was an intimidating fast bowler, one of the fastest England have ever produced. His pace, bounce, aggression and swing made him deadly on all kinds of pitches across the world.
When I was in college, I had also worked on the programming side of radio. One of my favorite projects was a weekly show I initiated, combining the music and folklore of different cultures. (I like to claim I invented world beat.) I knew almost nothing about either, so it was a big adventure each week to go to the university's excellent music-school library and rummage through the record bins.
In the end, we got everything cleaned out and they apartments offered them a new apartment since the condition of the carpet, walls, and just everything in general was in such deplorable condition. I also told them that I wouldn't help them a second time. I don't think I could handle doing something like that more than once. I even refurnished their new place since all their furniture was ruined. T.V., couch, tables and chairs, beds, dressers, etc. I found all of it for them. Most of it was donated and some were my personal things.

Personally, I am a fan of books like this that help bridge the gap to help children graduate from reading Bible picture books to actually digesting Scripture. And while it is not a homeschool "curriculum", it would certainly adapt well as a Bible curriculum, especially if your family enjoys the New Living Translation. On the other hand, children this age are incredibly impressionable. They are thinking and absorbing so much. It is time to sharpen up on your theology. I have read some Bible storybooks where the stories are retold in a way that uses soft theology or even sways the story by adding (or omitting) details to the original text. The mere fact that someone picks and chooses only certain Bible stories to retell means that the person has at least some control of what the final presentation looks like. In this book, Carolyn Larsen has condensed the Scripture to retell each story, but (as you can see from the one example above) she is merely eliminating details that may cause a young brain (or even my old brain) to scatter and wander. It brings the story focus, and keeps the truth. Larsen has taken the opportunity to use the "Now What" section to tie in the big picture of the Gospel right from the beginning. For me, this is an essential element that I look for in a good book. One of the first things I did was flip to the back of the book to the stories telling of Jesus' death and resurrection and the early church. I read through the "Now What" sections looking for any details that may tell my child how or why to become saved. At first, it appeared that I wouldn't find what I was looking for. Disappointed, I flipped to Genesis. There it was. With the telling of Adam and Eve's sin, came the Gospel. Right at the beginning, exactly where it was needed. We need a Savior and here's why and here is where you can find Him.
The day of the big dance, the twins are instructed to clean their rooms and while doing so, Elizabeth discovers George's letter to Enid. Using her mad Jessica Fletcher skillz, she finally deducts that it was her unhinged sister that told Ronnie about George. Of course, instead of confronting her like a normal person, Elizabeth begins to plot her revenge. Seeing as the last book established her unique brand of crap vengeance, she's probably just planning to hide Jessica's hairbrush or something.

I had never seen so many hippies in one place outside Central Park. We were all over the grounds and buildings, setting up tents and campsites outdoors and inside, utilizing the communal kitchen, and playing together everywhere. Perhaps what amazed me most during that week was how careful we were to keep the place clean, how nothing was trashed or damaged, how all of us were committed to leaving the grounds as we'd found them or even better.
Ok, well, let me try to at least fulfill some of the award requirements..lol
P.S. Not to beg, but know of any specific job opportunities in NYC, or have any ideas? I'm looking, since I may need something standard until I can launch my dreams...Any assistance, advice would be greatly appreciated.

I spent this past weekend at a retreat at the Seabeck Conference Center. I had to smile as I drove into Seabeck. The business district, if I don't count the Conference Center, consists of only about a half a dozen buildings, but when I arrived in town I was greeted by a small gray building with a bright blue door. White trim around the window caused the red "Espresso" sign to pop. I decided to go inside. The usual rows of flavors were lined up on a shelf; an espresso machine and a barista were visible from behind a tiny counter. Five or six wooden stools filled the remaining floor space- stools that were all occupied by the locals. They are a generous lot. I discovered that they will tease anyone. They didn't penalize me for being a visitor; locals and visitors are all teased alike.

The point here is surely not to deride empiricism. Heaven knows conservatism could stand to quit leading with its heart and start thinking more empirically about the world as it is, not the world as they wish it to be. The point, if I'm reading them correctly, is that too many leading voices on the left give themselves over to wonkiness, and presume that their moral convictions are widely shared, such that the only reason anybody could disagree with them is through ignorance (willful or not), or malice.
I've been dating a little bit, and its been fun. Both men and women. There is one very pretty grrrrr in Ellensburg but it seems like we are both gravitating in different directions. I've found someone that I think I really like, and I'm a little surprised because it is not someone that would ever catch my eye...I mean, the kind of person that you go by in the grocery store and don't even notice. But once you make yourself look, well, his heart is like a kaleidoscope of radiant gems and syrups. My own juices are flowing with the bright heat of summer, and love is floating with the fuzzy cotton tree seeds in the wind.

And the thing I am most proud of: I reupholstered my dining chairs. To be fair, the last one's seat pad is not yet reattached. After finishing three chairs Friday, I couldn't sleep because the muscles in my hands were quite literally on FIRE. I hearkened back to the days when I used to work out to the tune of retired military personnel "motivation," and I realize I never hurt that badly. But check this out:

The love we made that brought our bodies one to one
The fact that it's almost Cinco de Mayo got me thinking about, well, of all things, Cinco de Mayo. In high school I lived about two hours north of the Mexican border in West Covina, California. Being a suburb of L.A., there were a number of easy access attractions available to young people including Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm (amazing pies and fried chicken), the famed Southern California beaches where I spent most of my summers, the San Diego Zoo and Tijuana, or T.J. as we referred to it.
That view, of connections to one another, could have begun in the ancient Jewish belief of blessings and cursings. The translators of Christ's words may have been a bit leery of the idea of cursing someone. "Blessed are the meek" was fine. But cursing the un-meek? Did they change the words so that we read now the easier-to-digest "woe unto him"? As in, perhaps, "woe unto him who hurts the least of these, the children." . Sounds safe enough until you realize this may be an example of the Jewish belief in cursing someone, in proclaiming your hope in his receiving his just desserts for a particular behavior. Pedophilia, anyone?
Not only did I rework that original block, but I have since done more applique' work (that Scrappy Dresden Plate quilt I'm working on requires applique', as do the monthly minis for Sandy's monthly QAL) and now in charge of the design for our next guild Opportunity (raffle) Quilt for 2014. Do you know what I've chosen for us to do? You guessed it if you said, "an applique' quilt"! I'll save that whole story for another day, but for now, I want to tell you about an idea that our friend, Flo shared during our coffee group.
Sorry, goat.
And so I began. I used the instructions I found online as my chief guide but after three days I was a little skeptical that the sour dough had fermented enough or produced enough yeast. My Twitter friend Finn said that he had been feeding his starter ("Veruca") for 12 days and it was now time. So I asked him if he thought my starter was ready? He confirmed what I thought and said no. So I've been letting "Finn Jr". grow and grow. Last night he became a rebellious teenager and we woke up to him trying to escape the safety of his jar to explore the world (thus the picture above this posting).
No matter how funky things get, Withers plays it cool . We've all probably heard "Lean On Me" too many times by now. But next time, listen to the song in the context of all the gospel soul that was hitting the charts in 1972: Aretha Franklin's Young Gifted And Black and Amazing Grace, The Staple Sisters's "I'll Take You There", Jesus Christ Superstar. The Rolling Stones's "Let It Loose" and "Shine A Light"? Could the compassionate singer be JC himself?

In addition to this study-load I threw myself under a Roadlink Bus by opting to sign up for the Google AdWords Certification Program to increase my work capabilities (requires min 85% to pass). This means the possibility of not only getting run over by a bus but having it crumble on top of me too! Yikes! For those not in the know, check out why I've made reference to Roadlink here :-P
I just love it and I think I have found a new passion. Tranferware! I have a few pieces but definitely will keep my eye out for more to go in my collection. One thought is to make this into a lovely sink for a powder room in our new one-day home. Hubby also came home with these:
You might be in pain and feeling alone - but as always, you hide it with humour and smiles? Which is fuckin' stupid really, because you're certainly not laughing are you?! You're known for your smile - so use it!
I don't know.maybe nobody else feels like this about indie publishing. But this is sort of where I think I am with it. It's wonderful on so many levels - but its big flaw, I think, is that it's just too easy. Too easy to implement.too easy to mess up.too easy to get discouraged (because your frame of reference when you're solo is really quite small). Too easy, essentially, to jump in when you're green and flounder around.because you're green.
If I didn't know any better i'd be an alcoholic by now, good thing i'm smarter than that. "And the worlds got me dizzy again, you'd think after 24 years i'd be used to the spin." man this line by Conor is so damn true. "But you may be offended and you may be afraid but don't walk away, don't walk away." "And our freedoms a joke we're just taking a piss."
Then finally, they put me on depakote. I am mentioning this drug by name because I have heard from several other women that they believe depakote was the cause of this for them too, and a doctor at a California University said that he strongly, strongly believes that it gives PCOS to young women. Then I heard that some doctors have been instructed not to prescribe it to women under 40. Depakote won't own up to that and they knowingly let the doctors prescribe it (at least, until recently from what I hear). I don't want to get into who my sources are because I don't want to get anyone in trouble. It's very good for seizures, my brother had to take it for years and it kept him alive, but for Bipolar- not so much.
Right - that's your lot, i'm keeping this one short and sweet this week (well, as short as Moi could manage anyway!).

Alas, all these things (and more) would be nice. Having a real live person answer the phone when you call your phone company for assistance would be nice too, but those days are gone, for better or for worse. All these things would be nice, but we live in a technological era of continuously improving efficiencies (ie. if a computer can do it, let the computer do it). We also live in a sensitive and litigious era and for a potential employer to provide really honest feedback would open themselves up to human rights lawsuits and poor public relations. This is the era we live in and you can't change that. But what you can do is live with it and work through it. Besides, if an employer screens you out for any reason that would be a potential human rights issue,or anything that has absolutely nothing to do with your ability to excel in the job, chances are you don't want to work for that organization anyways.
To sum it all up, I believe that every writer/director/cinematographer should watch this prank which turned into a viral video ad campaign for TNT.

When we allow ourselves to let go of wanting the other to fill us up, when we let ourselves be real, as we are, another energy comes through our body and being. It will charge our entire being with a presence, a force that is absolutely free of wanting. We feel open, grounded, free, humble and powerful - zero and everything. It is as through our body, heart and soul simultaneously flower in reverential awe of the moment. This force is an exquisite expression of the flower of life itself.

Mary Saenz, has a nimble memory. It is a Queen Anne cup, and based on the engraver, materials, and the fact that it does not have a lid, she agreed that the trophy could have been circa 1983 for Bates Motel. The stories lined up.

I want to start with talking about Sawyer and Kate because I believe that this relationship was arguably the more apparent of the two, definitely the more active and perhaps even the more popular choice for indifferent/casual viewers. Why? Because Sawyer and Kate together was the obvious choice, the easy choice, and the in many ways expected direction for the characters to head in.
Seems to be the case that for some reason, the Left (as I'll call them here), have been brainwashed into thinking the EDL are a violent Nazi group. My experience is that it's the UAF that are against free speech, human rights and are willing to let this country go to the dogs! If you believe in democracy, why do you protest at anybody else's parade, demo or whatever?
Now, it doesn't take much to connect-the-dots here and figure out that these actions could seriously endanger not only the lives and well being of the officers involved, but their families and homes as well. One has to wonder too, what might be the percentage of Catholic officers and families placed in harms way by this foul act.
And it's not just Arabs. For instance, one member of the organization's finance committee, Genevieve Lynch, was a participant of the National Iranian American Council. Judith Barnett, a former registered agent for Saudi Arabia, is a donor and is prominent on the J Street Advisory Council. while Nancy Dutton, who until 2008 represented the Saudis as an attorney against her fellow Americans donates to J Street's political action committee which has been financing anti-Israeli congressional candidates.

This is Tangerine Tango Glitter. This was the main reason I wanted this set. I had never really seen a glitter this color before. This has orange and coppery glitters that give it amazing dimension. This polish just glows! I can't wait to wear it as a pedi once I have a tan. haha This polish started out thin, but the longer it was open the thicker it became. But that 's pretty normal for a glitter. Below is 3 coats.

2. Bring an Abundance of Water and Food on Hikes: The rule of thumb when hiking is: when half of your water supply is gone, start heading back. Last summer I hiked Upper Yosemite Falls, one of the oldest trails in Yosemite, and leads to the highest waterfall in North America at 2,425 ft. It took me 3 hours to hike up and I tried to conserve my water as much as possible but unfortunately I was not able to. Fortunately, when I finally got to the top there was a benevolent man who was filtering water, from the waterfall, to give to weary hikers. Make sure to bring snacks that are high in protein and carbohydrates such as granola bars and nuts because when the hike says strenuous, it means it!
Don't lose your soul trying to please someone else. Focus on growing as an individual. Praise from others doesn't always equate to peace of mind. Take their words with a grain of salt. You're priceless. Nothing will ever change that.

It may take extra effort to find all the needed supplies since everything is just tossed willy-nilly in there, but I refuse to go another weekend without crafting in my own space. So that will be my end goal for this week: make one card in remodeled craft room. How hard that that be? Really? LOL LOL

Wade comes out and looks ready. Justin Robbins comes out to some club music, and the crowd is getting pretty rowdy. Choate has a bit of a size advantage over Robbins, but it sounds like Justin has the crowd on his side.
I also feel a change coming in me. I prefer to stay at home, or go for a quiet dinner, or watch a movie. I don't like clubbing anymore, or going and getting "wasted" which is what most of my friends do. Nothing wrong with that at all. But I am just not there anymore. My idea of a good night out now is relaxing at home with a good movie, or going to a cinema, or cooking dinner, or going out to eat. If alcohol must be involved, a nice quiet bar where we can sit and talk.
I had a lot of issues with the title. Nothing seemed right and after putting 2 different styles down, I decided to use a stamp from Finishing Touch Ideas with a ink that went well with the paper. The paint under it really lifted the title.
Mendy, as much as I, found this almost too good to be true and a bit hard to believe, even though all sorts of wonderful beings show up in her office all the time. As she said later, though, she has a great deal of experience with this stuff and she feels confident of being able to sniff out a fraud. Stephen did not appear to be a fraud, not to either of us. I had a feeling of the sublime, no sense of anything that might raise an alarm.

This post wants to highlight the challenges, that come along with the recent phenomenon of Chinese tourists, as well as discuss Taiwan's current struggles as a travel destination and travel nation. Taiwan is truly a big step ahead of China, when it comes to travel etiquette and service, however, there is still room for improvement. I believe, that we need to give Chinese tourists some time, they will make mistakes and we need to firmly point them out, but they will also learn and improve through time - some more, some less. I'm interested to hear what you say! Here are some of my questions:
1) Happy March! It's the first day of Spring! (In my head, anyway). We haven't had much winter but I'm ready for those ocassional cold days to be completely behind us. Plus, I also kind of love the stormy season we have here. Don't so much love the kids being confined to the house on rainy days but I love, love, love a good night time thunderstorm.
This film is crazy but there is streak of dark humour running through it all. Rupert Everett narrates Francesco's thoughts throughout the film, including his meditations on the meaning of life death and love. Francesco is never a nice person but I don't get this modern obsession with creating likeable protagonists. I love this film and I know other people may not. If you like Italian horror or zombie films you may enjoy this too
Our first destination, although we didn't stop was a place called Macapa which is on the northern side of the Amazon where we picked up our pilot to show us the way down the river to Santarem. Didn't see the pilot but this river is so convoluted with masses of islands and tributaries, you would get hopelessly lost, not to say run aground. They put up a special map of the river where our charts are and there are several rivers at the mouth which go on for miles and miles. Because of these islands, we passed very close to the shoreline which was littered with driftwood. The trees rose straight from the water's edge and there were big reeds and grasses. Passing us, in the river were big clumps of green, various vegetation just drifting past with brown logs bobbing up and down. Thought they were crocodiles at first. Macapa, right on the equator looks like quite a large town, houses, tall buildings and some masts showing. Little huts down at the water's edge, but didn't see many people around apart from a few who were fishing in narrow boats. A tug boat called Titan was pulling two huge rafts piled high with sand and it was hot and humid out on deck.

Outskirts Press was founded in 2002 by Brent Sampson and has quickly grown into one of the leading group of Print-on-demand publishers and providers of book publishing solutions. Based in Denver, Colorado, Outskirts Press was recognised as the third fastest growing privately held company in Colorado. Sampson himself has proved to be a widely successful author of POD publishing guides, including Sell Your Book on Amazon and Self-Publishing simplified.
In five stories, Christie allows the murderer to escape justice (and in the case of the last three, implicitly almost approves of their crimes); these are The Witness for the Prosecution, The Man in the Brown Suit, Murder on the Orient Express, Curtain and The Unexpected Guest. (When Christie adapted Witness into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed.) There are also numerous instances where the killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but instead dies (death usually being presented as a more 'sympathetic' outcome), for example Peril at End House, Death on the Nile, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Crooked House, Appointment with Death, The Hollow, and Secret Adversary. In some cases this is with the collusion of the detective involved. Five Little Pigs, and arguably Ordeal by Innocence, end with the question of whether formal justice will be done unresolved.
The new characters were incredibly underdeveloped; Angelica, Blackbeard, the Minister, and the mermaid all felt forced upon the audience as if we were suppose to enjoy them, but realistically they were just annoying. Angelica is mad at Jack for taking her virginity (wasn't pirates suppose to be geared for Children?) Blackbeard hides in his cabin for most of the film (wasn't he the scariest pirates of all time?) the Minister falls in love with the mermaid (who in this film can shoot spiderwebs from their wrists like Spider-Man) just because he sees her naked (again, Disney, Pirates, Children?) and the Mermaid needs to shed one tear (there were enough tears of pain from the audience to solve that problem).
This year tested that faith. There is no way around it: This was a lousy year in sports. Scandal. Disgrace. Crime. The horror in and around sports rose to previously unimagined depths -- the empire struck back, the dark side reigned. Penn State dominated the news, but there were charges elsewhere, in too many places, in Miami and Ohio State and Syracuse and, well, who could keep up? Players went on strike. Owners locked out. Fan favorites left town. Legends went on trial. Concussions. Perjury. PEDs.

I lazed around all day, catching up on tv shows that I had missed while I was gone, and catching up on a few things online. It was so nice to have air conditioning, electricity, my computer, my phone, and my bed. All things that I missed on the trip.
A journal is also something that you can use to comfort your feelings when you are ashamed to do so any other way. You may want to make sure that you are including everything that has happened since your divorce started. You can make sure that you are keeping track of the daily things that make you sad or things that you do to make yourself feel better. As you are writing you will see that your true emotions are coming out and that you are finally able to make some head way on rebuilding your life for the better.
I can tell you how NOT to go about things. One, clean yourself and your truck up. If I were to have land and Homeboy showed up in his 4X4 with dog boxes and a bumper sticker that read "Hog Hunters Do It In The Brush" I'll probably call the cops. Think about that, seriously. The South is known for its rednecks, but that sorta thing won't garner positive attention.

The sad part of this journey to attain mind-body synchronization is that it is implicitly flawed by human hubris. Man's character flaw of ego hides from man the manner in which Jiriki, salvation from within, can be attained. It is for this reason that one who desires to embrace Jiriki Kata-Do, inner salvation from Kata, must abandon and surrender human hubris.
As mentioned a couple of weeks ago, we now only display a handful of non-functional pieces: the occasional glass of flowers or foraged plants, the painting on our largest wall, the found animal skull in the playroom (Max enjoys science and biology) and a couple of pieces in our shared office/studio. But we're not forever-attached to any of them. I find that visual beauty abounds around us and does not need to be canvas-bound. Beauty "is in the eye of the beholder" and can be found everywhere and anywhere: In the yellow bird outside of my window, in the light filtering through my chihuahua's ears, in the new shoots sprouting from my living wall, in my kids smiles, and in simple functional items in the home.

Now, "making an example" of someone, to me, is the stuff of wartime prison camps. Not civil courts in peacetime. You cannot reasonably over-punish a high-visibility convict to deter those who might follow. Not fair. Nor, of course, could punishment by proxy be justified, supposing it were provable. Fact is, though, that a young man who clearly has some problems is being locked in with people who are more likely to supplement his trauma than to show him the way to enlightenment. And we are paying for it. I would say that the law is an ass. But I don't want to be in contempt of court, do I?
A white community in 1950's Chicago frets about the African-American family about to move in. Fast-forward to the present day, and the same house represents very different demographics.

I was lunching at Gaylords (still there, and still terrific) in Fitzrovia with two contacts, and we were one of just four tables occupied. Afterwards, I strolled round the restaurant-packed area and spoke to some owners. Two admitted they didn't think they'd make it through next year unless things looked up. All said their Christmas bookings were well down before around December 15th. What seemed to be depressing most of them was the total absence of any sign of improvement.
Micky is wonderful: she wiggles when I come near her and when I stroke her she starts purring like a kitty and rubs her little head on my fingers. Incredible. I know she needs a real partner - but what can I do at the moment?
2. Francis Alys' Fabiola at LACMA: Archive projects are usually awful - aesthetically mute, didactic, and boring. This exhibition proved that that does not have to be the case. Human, smart, and full of wonder, it was basically everything I need from art.
When Abram finally requests the hand of his beautiful half sister Sarai, she asks only one thing- that he not take another wife. Her father finds this promise restrictive and only agrees if she makes a promise as well. She has to procure Abram a son and heir or else Abram's promise is null and void. Sarai is confident that she can keep up her end of the deal, so she agrees.

There was a problem with Shirley's printer which held up the order slightly and so she was extremely kind and sent me this other Love design as a special surprise, and it's now brightening up the side of my wardrobe. As mentioned before I do not like the wardrobes in my bedroom and they desperately need painting cream but now I see this pretty print instead of the wood and I just adore it. (Sorry for the reflections in the glass!)
As things stand at the moment, it is the prevailing view within the Church of England that -- to adopt a minimalist position -- God's Word on the subject of marriage is relatively clear. If there is dissent from that view in the congregation, it is therefore surely the task of the teaching office to correct it.
Having a good reputation is something you want in the music business. It sounds like obvious good advice for artists to tell them to be able to play well with others, but this also needs to include others you might not like or want to play with. In todays music business, you may come across and have to work with people you don't like, they might be doing things you cant stand, but bashing them excessively online or around others is not going to help you get what you want in the end.

While the first narrative was about people who had a multitude of reasons to not be happy, the second one could've almost been a fairytale. Here we meet Antoine (Kevin Parent) a middle-aged DJ who is living an enviable life raising two gorgeous daughters with his equally pretty girlfriend (Evelyne Brochu). But life is not always a bed of roses because he still thinks of his ex-wife (Hélène Florent), his first love and original soul mate.

Deep in to the first thirty minutes or so of the chick flick and I found myself thinking about story. Just the word and what it means. It was during the scenes in which the graduated "It" girls arrived in Abu Dhabi that my mind began to wander. You see this is where I noticed the story that had pulled me in during the first half hour shifted its focus from story telling to showiness. Somewhere, someone must have stated that the second installment of the movie must be bigger or needed more, I'll use Ms. Bradshaw's word, "sparkle" than its predecessor. Yeah I get it, in a vast sea of sequels they had to dream up some way for theirs to standout, but along the way they forgot about story. And how a well written, relatable tale can pull in and take hold of an audience every time.

...His album output slowed in the 1990s, and eventually he stopped releasing albums altogether. In 1993 he and four members of the Afrika '70 organization were arrested for murder. The battle against military corruption in Nigeria was taking its toll, especially during the rise of dictator Sani Abacha. Rumors were also spreading that he was suffering from an illness for which he was refusing treatment. On 3 August 1997, Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, already a prominent AIDS activist and former Minister of Health, stunned the nation by announcing his younger brother's death a day earlier from Kaposi's sarcoma which was brought on by AIDS. More than a million people attended Fela's funeral at the site of the old Shrine compound. A new Africa Shrine has opened since Fela's death in a different section of Lagos under the supervision of his son Femi Kuti...

Let's examine the second half of the video. One protester calls out 'Mic check!,' and everyone knows what this means. This guy will speak for us, he has something to say. And if they disagree, they can simply stop passing this person's words along. But in this case he speaks words of de-escalation. We will let you police leave. He's teaching the police a lesson in non-violence. It's amazing to see this at work.

The biggest thing is with Oldest and her boyfriends daughter, who's 3. The mom just up and left for the 4th time, leaving the daughter with Oldest and Boyfriend. No contact for over a month! Oldest and Boyfriend went to a lawyer to see what they could do, and the lawyer said NOTHING. Yep, nothing. A judge in our county won't rule against a mom who has several domestic violence charges called to her home, who has pulled a gun on her current boyfriend several times, has a mental illness, and has had several attempted suicides!

Ann, or perhaps Jo, said that one impressive thing about the novel was the way that early on we are led to see the Garners as unusually philanthropic slave owners, but later realize that this is just a matter of relativity, and that they have their own cruelties. I said that one of the most horrifying moments for me, though, was not the out-and-out cruelty from which it's easy to distance oneself, but the incident towards the end when Sethe's living daughter Denver goes to the abolitionists' house to ask for work. Here she comes across something which horrifies her: a small statue of a black child with its head pulled back and its lower lip extended to receive coins casually thrown down, ready for paying tradesmen - a figure so like the Little-Black-Sambo collection figures that stood unremarked outside shops and in arcades in my own childhood, that I was pushed up suddenly against my own unconscious collusion in racism.

I finally switched on my computer (largely because I had an e-mail from a French friend that asked why there were no results) and found the HuffPo summary immediately. No surprises. Labour making gains at the government's expense - it was expected and is not unusual for local elections around half-way through a government's life. Under the Thatcher government this used to happen quite often yet the lady went on to lead her party to victory several times.

Written for ages 6 and older this is one of many delightful books in the Katie Woo series. I no longer have children or grandchildren this age but the title reminded me of my 8-year-old granddaughter (kind of a Madame Fullcharge) and I thought she and I would have fun reading it together. She wasn't interested. Said it was too young for her. That might be because she just finishing up her 4th grade brothers book, Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief. Anyway I thought the book was great and I still think she would have enjoyed it. I'll bet if I could have figured out how to get it onto Kindle she may have read it.
There was that time I watched my father in a televised drama where he was portraying yet another down and out character. There was a part where he was cold and shivering and sad, and I am told I came out from under the dining table that was my favourite hiding spot and offered my blankie to the television set saying "Here daddy, you can have my blankie, you don't have to be cold!" The adults thought that was the sweetest, funniest thing ever, but to my four year old mind, my father was suffering and I wanted to help. I knew he was pretending, but could I be really, really sure he wasn't actually cold?
I followed my parent's home, even though they weren't aware of my presense. My mom wept all the way while my dad remained silent. He begged my mom to calm down but it all fell on deaf ears. We got home to find the house filled with friends and relatives, my Dad carried my body and laid it on the mat in the living room. Prayers for forgiveness were said, and my parents were advised to stop crying as it wouldn't bring me back. I watched my Mom cry and weep all night as she asked God why He Had to take my life.

Covey amplifies his message by means of wide-ranging examples of "third alternative thinkers". There's the local police force that transformed a crime-plagued community by casting off its entrenched "them against us" mentality. Another example tells the tale of a father who, during the course of one extraordinary evening, rescued his daughter from years of clinical depression. Then there's the judge who brought a swift and peaceful end to a massive environmental lawsuit without setting foot in a courtroom.

As stated in his book "The Leadership Engine", Tichy Noel reinforces that learning is a key requirement for developing leadership. We enhance our unique qualities through learning and education. Studying abroad was probably one of the richest experiences of my life. It was a privilege to study for my MBA at Duke, The Fuqua School of Business. It was a unique moment of my life. The globally focused education allowed me to make a deep personal assessment while providing me with an actionable set of global leadership tools. (Not to mention that I met my wife during my MBA, this is awesome).
Most artists today get inspired by other people, literature, nature etc.; not by goddesses. Camille Claudel inspired the French sculptor Auguste Rodin, and was his muse. He expected her to be there for him, like a goddess would be. By doing so, he prevented her to make name as an artist herself. Recently, some specialists think that many sculptures of Rodin are actually made by Claudel.
Not everyone is a fan of Valentine's Day, and although I'm one of those as well, I just want to be clear that unlike my last book, Fractured Facade, this short story is not about me. Well, some "elements" of the tale are based on true life experiences, but not necessarily mine.

Although Emily knows her math facts fairly well, she could stand to improve her speed, so I was interested to see how Math Rider would stack up against other programs we've tried. It teaches mastery of all 4 math operations with numbers 1-12 and is designed for children ages 6-12. To play, the child begins a "quest." A short story scenario is given, then the child rides his or her horse, "Shadow," across deserts, mountains, and so on. Math problems appear at the bottom of the screen. As the problem is answered, the horse jumps over an obstacle. If the problem is missed, the horse stops while the game gives the correct answer. The problems and speed are adjusted to the child's abilities, with problems the child has trouble with generated more frequently.
Established in 1892, CILEx was known as the Institute of Legal Executives (ILEX) in 1963 before changing its name in January 2012 when it received a royal charter. According to CILEx, 81.5 per cent of its members have parents who studied at university. Only 2 per cent of members have a lawyer for a parent. Clearly, CILEx operates in different circles from the magic-circle law firms, which have attracted criticism in the past for using the old boys' network of recruitment.

It is relatively obvious that certain international business pursuits are more likely to influence environmental conditions. These types of businesses need to be especially concerned about the fashion in which they conduct business. They must assure citizens that the environment will not be tarnished for decades to come. I have no qualms about them facilitating business in an international setting, but they need to make sure that the environment doesn't become degraded as a result of their organizational operations.

The Rally Fighter was prototyped in the workshop at the back of the Wareham office, but manufacturing muscle also came from Factory Five Racing, a kit-car company and Local Motors investor located just down the road. Of course, the kit-car business has been around for decades, standing as a proof of concept for how small manufacturing can work in the car industry. Kit cars combine hand-welded steel tube chassis and fiberglass bodies with stock engines and accessories. Amateurs assemble the cars at their homes, which exempts the vehicles from many regulatory restrictions (similar to home-built experimental aircraft). Factory Five has sold about 8,000 kits to date.

At around dusk, Emi asked if I wanted to go for a walk in the woods, and of course I said yes. We picked up a friend of hers on the way. It rained this afternoon, and everything had that fresh, sweet smell that you always get after rain in the spring time. The Peepers were deafening as we picked our way through the slick mud, over wet rocks, and through damp grasses, fending off mosquitoes as we went. Emi tried to catch a frog (it was brown, though we're not sure what type it was.) as we wound our way through the flooded areas, looking for peepers and other frogs. We saw the colour of the sky through the trees as the sun set.
Well, we never made that myrtle. The problem wasn't the hogs busting us. It was the coyote. One old mangy dog was loitering around the herd. These pigs were big enough not to be bothered by a pesky song dog, but they certainly took notice of him after he caught wind of our activities and bounded away. The coup de grace, though, were the turkeys. A couple hens were holding sentry and naturally took off when they saw us, taking the finally-frightened hogs with them. Wild pigs don't have the best sense of sight, but they're wary enough to recognize something amiss. (And how strange is it to find a coyote, hogs, and turkeys hanging around each other outside of a Disney movie?)

It's unfair to you because you may not be aware of what you are signing up for, in which case, you may host their advertisements for free without making any money.

When I was in Phnom Penh recently, I discovered in the guidebook that there was a cafe called the "Lazy Gecko Cafe". I looked it up on the map and saw that it was quite far from where I was staying and also from most of the areas I would be visiting. However, the pull to seek out this lazy gecko was strong and on my final day, I decided to hunt it down and sink a coffee or two.

Our personal psychology is how our karmic patterns show up in this lifetime. A general Buddhist or Hindu perspective on karma suggests that the individual soul moves through consciousness lifetime after lifetime, incarnating again and again in the school of life in order to complete various tasks and lessons, and to release contractions of consciousness.

Hmm where do I start from? where? where? where.? Oh yeah, there!. So I'm quite certain that every believer knows what "New Creation" means (at least I hope so). When asked to define the term, words like "born-again", "salvation", "repentance", "baptism" etc are bound to be used in the definition. That's all good but who really is the "NEW CREATURE"? The creation story helped me understand this better so let's start from there. Once upon a time, God created man (and woman), gave him authority over everything on earth (Genesis 1:27-31) and placed him in the Garden of Eden where man could be close to HIM (GOD) all the time. One day, the enemy of God (and all God's children), satan, tricked man into sinning against God. Satan gave man "sin and the pleasures that come with it" and in return man gave up his authority over earth and everything in it, hence, man came under the rulership of satan. Uhmm.. yeah I guess you can call it an exchange. satan brought sin to man and man paid with his authority over the earth. A poor exchange indeed.but hey, it was no robbery. Anyway, satan, having all the authority now, become the ruler of man; and man the slave of satan (Jesus replied, "Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin" John 8:32). Man was forever doomed as a slave of the enemy and like anyone who is sentenced to life imprisonment without appeal, the only way of escape is DEATH. Scary huh? I know! Well, God who created man and loved man in spite of man's disobedience wanted to free His creation from bondage so He had to send no one else but LIFE to set man free. The Son of God, JESUS CHRIST is LIFE (Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the LIFE.John 14:6; "In him was LIFE.John 1:4). JESUS was/is the only ONE who can set man free.WHY? Think of it this way. Man's only hope of escaping the slavery of satan is death and we all know everyone dies but once. You have one chance to live and after that, there is death and judgement etc. God couldn't watch man die in his sins so there had to be another way to set man free and that way is JESUS. Jesus came on the earth as a man, suffered and died.but uh huh, that's the best part. He died not just for dying sake but He died so He could defeat DEATH. He had to defeat death so He could give man a second chance to life. For 3 days He was dead but on the 3rd day, He rose again having won POWER over death."..Whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have EVERLASTING life" John 3:16. Everlasting life is possible in Jesus because He holds both the power of LIFE (because He is LIFE) and DEATH(because He defeated death) in His hands. Any man who then believes in Him is set free from slavery through death but is given another chance to live and is given a NEW LIFE. Jesus creates the old slave who died anew and breathes LIFE again into his nostrils to make him a living soul.(Then the LORD God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being: Genesis 2:7). This is why anyone who is born-again/born in Christ is said to be a NEW CREATURE (Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new: 2 Corinthians 5:17). Just like the first man ever created, the NEW CREATURE is not placed back on in the world he just got freed from, he is placed into a world, a place, a kingdom where he can be close to God again. The NEW CREATURE no longer belongs to the world of sin and slavery (.because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you- John 15:19). The blessings and authority (Gen. 1:28-31) man God first gave to man before the fall is returned to the NEW CREATURE who becomes part of the body of Christ (.and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all- Ephe. 1:20-23). Yup! Not only does the NEW YOU receive freedom and salvation in CHRIST, but you also receive power and authority over satan and his followers. So now you know.The "NEW YOU" who is born in CHRIST is more powerful and more important than can be comprehended. YOU are God's own precious POSSESSION bought at a very high price. YOU are PRICELESS as could be. Turn to HIS WORD to fully know the "NEW YOU" He created.

That's it. There aren't really any short cuts. People always want short cuts. New acts often want to know how to get an agent. The chances are that any act asking how to get an agent doesn't really need an agent. And when they're at a stage where an agent can help them, they'll find there are agents there offering to help. That's how it works.

Meet Samantha. But we hardly ever call her that. Mostly, we call her Little D. That's D, for Diva. Because it's all about her. After a long weekend visiting family in Pennsylvania, we came home and adopted her at the humane society. There, she was named Thelma. You can plainly see that name just didn't suit her. (Actually, I wanted to name her Tootsie and the hubby wanted to name her Tarot. Then I jokingly suggested Samantha because she was being a little naughty at the time - she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter. Anyway, I said to my hubby that we should call her Samantha because "naughty girls need love too". Ha. What can I say, I was a teenager in the 80s.)

Such determination in her work life goes hand in hand with sacrifices in her social life. She often finds herself declining invites to parties or social gatherings in favour of a few more hours sewing or attending a networking event. When this happens, Judith simply reminds herself "Well they are only drinking wine, I'm not really missing out on that much". This sort of perspective has helped her throughout her career.
I am a preschool teacher for Toddlers. I have a class full of 2 year olds and in addition to making the children feel safe and loved, I have to plan curriculum on a monthly basis to help develop important skills. The following is a list of activities I've applied to my classroom which can be used by teachers and parents alike!

Every time the subject of marriage comes up, I have to shake my head at the single girls I know. Some of them are younger than I am, some of them are my age, some older. They all want that holy grail of dating and relationships - a husband. It's like some crowning achievement. An end game. Life would only be complete if I had a husband.
Overall: I feel largely indifferent to the writing and characterizations. Instead of a cute sweet book, I feel like I ended up with something aspiring to be deeper but failing.

Once you have your paper cut out in the size you want, I generally use my Xacto knife to score my folds (very gently, I really don't even push, just drag the blade gently across the paper). I score the "pretty side" of my paper, not the back. A ruler helps to keep your lines straight, if you don't trust yourself scoring the paper, you can also line up your ruler and fold against it to keep your folds crisp.
The implication of preparing to move Russian troops not only is to protect its own vital regional interests but possibly to assist Iran in the event of such an attack. Sources add that a Russian military buildup in the region could result in the Russian military potentially engaging Israeli forces, U.S. forces, or both.

...His album output slowed in the 1990s, and eventually he stopped releasing albums altogether. In 1993 he and four members of the Afrika '70 organization were arrested for murder. The battle against military corruption in Nigeria was taking its toll, especially during the rise of dictator Sani Abacha. Rumors were also spreading that he was suffering from an illness for which he was refusing treatment. On 3 August 1997, Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, already a prominent AIDS activist and former Minister of Health, stunned the nation by announcing his younger brother's death a day earlier from Kaposi's sarcoma which was brought on by AIDS. More than a million people attended Fela's funeral at the site of the old Shrine compound. A new Africa Shrine has opened since Fela's death in a different section of Lagos under the supervision of his son Femi Kuti...

With Britain looking increasingly likely to secure possession of Palestine, it paved the way for the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a letter addressed to Victor's uncle, Lionel Walter Rothschild, which promised that His Majesty's government would do their utmost to establish 'a national home for the Jewish people' in Palestine. It was a 'declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations', and ultimately led to the creation of Israel. Today Balfour Day is celebrated there on November 2nd.
Next, write down all the skills you need to learn or to work on. If you are just getting started with writing, you may find this difficult. If people have made comments on your writing, you can use those comments to make your list. If, for instance, you have been told that your characters are not believable or your descriptions fuzzy, then the skills of creating characters and writing description go on your list. Or try this: read over a piece of writing by your favorite author, writing you consider excellent. Now write down all the things the writer does that make this piece so good. How many of these things can you do now? How many of them do you need to learn how to do?
As Grace picked out clothing for Doris to wear, Doris looked at the blouse Grace had chosen with disgust and said, "Grace that has to be the ugliest blouse I have ever seen! Is that yours?" "This is your favorite blouse Mom. You've had it for over two years and worn it at least a hundred times." Grace replied as she held up the garment. "That isn't mine. I have never seen that blouse before in my life. Why would you say such a thing?" No one knows what she was thinking, but Doris wasn't about to admit that she had forgotten. As she put on her socks Doris asked, "Did you check the mail, Grace?" "Yeah, Mom, Bubba brought it to you over an hour ago." Grace answered as she walked over and picked up the mail and showed it to Doris.

For this also there is no technological or large-scale solution. Perhaps, as they believe, the most conscientiously up-to-date people can easily do without local workshops and stores, local journalism, a local newspaper, a local post office, all of which supposedly have been replaced by technologies. But what technology can replace personal privacy or the coherence of a family or a community? What technology can undo the collateral damages of an inhuman rate of technological change?
Google now has a head start on its rivals in the fiercely competitive cloud computing market, thanks in part to deals inked with the US Patent and Trademark Office and the General Services Administration in the past year. In both cases, Google enjoyed the benefits of support from federal chief information officers. In both cases, a few people involved in the process voiced objections.

Several people have asked me for easy, healthy recipes. I'm kind of a wing-it person, so I'm always on the look-out for good websites or books to help with quick, easy cooking. I found one that's definitely a keeper. Simple Food for Busy Families: The Whole Life Nutrition Approach is a fabulous resource with step-by-step instructions on how to turn your family's bad eating habits around. The first half of the book addresses everything from getting enough sleep to why it makes sense to eat seasonal food. Each section gives practical tips on how to implement changes slowly in your family's routine so that eventually you're eating better and feeling better.
It is difficult to make a living from writing. I haven't cracked it yet, although I can see my income growing as I get more interest from foreign publishers and - crucially - manage to keep on producing books. If I compare it, though, to my career in journalism, I'm quite happy. Although I could earn considerably more with a staff job on a national newspaper (and they aren't any easier to come by than getting a book deal), my salary would be pretty much my limit. Whereas a book..well, anything could happen. It's possible for a book to earn for you again and again - a foreign sale here, a film deal there - while you're working on other stuff.

As stated in his book "The Leadership Engine", Tichy Noel reinforces that learning is a key requirement for developing leadership. We enhance our unique qualities through learning and education. Studying abroad was probably one of the richest experiences of my life. It was a privilege to study for my MBA at Duke, The Fuqua School of Business. It was a unique moment of my life. The globally focused education allowed me to make a deep personal assessment while providing me with an actionable set of global leadership tools. (Not to mention that I met my wife during my MBA, this is awesome).

How can I do that? Did you happen to read my entry from yesterday? It goes along quite well with this thought. I must practice three things: justice, mercy and humility. All three are admirable traits in royalty. Isn't it what you envision when you think of a king, queen, prince or princess?

I know I'm just a crass American with no business chiming in on finer points of eti-quette and pro-to-col ... but I do know about a bit about trying mothers-in-law. So, I've taken the liberty of channeling my inner Dear Abby and drafting a little missive of my own:
And by the laughter, I surmise that she could tell without me letting her in on the secret. Apparently, besides my accent deepening into obscurity, I raised my voice several decibels and reverted to my Ghanenglish grammar peppered with Dagbani, something that is significantly different from the speech my Canadian-raised family is used to. And now I'm laughing and blushing, and internally cringing because I feel proud to retain vestiges of my Ghanaian communication skills, but wondering how to balance this maintenance of my slightly shifted identity while re-learning how to connect with Canadians. Especially because I need to sound polished and professional at my upcoming interviews for medicine.

All in all, yes, I had a very successful race. But that success didn't come without what felt to me like significant struggles. This was a very challenging race for me both mentally and physically. I set more specific and bigger goals than I usually do and I had my first taste of what it's like to really push yourself hard to achieve them. I think I am slowly evolving from just being happy to finish to also wanting to fulfill a few goals along the way. I will always be that runner who is thrilled to just be upright and smiling at the finish line but maybe there's room in there for a bit more than that.
Dad went for a walk around when we got there and mum and i got the boys into their swimmers. Then Jordy was straight in the river and wanting to go floating off downstream. Mum had Darcy and i was still getting ready to get in and Jordy is off! Little bugger. I was a bit worried about him going over the edge of the waterfall but i met him down the end and he kicked over to me. Not that it was a big waterfall! He would not have been hurt if he went over but he might have scared himself.
First I placed a straight pin through the center of a red felt Pretty Posy, then I placed it through each section of the wheel as I bent it in. Then I used the pin to attach the pinwheel to the eraser of the pencil. I bent the pin down and taped it securely to the pencil so no fingers would get pricked.

After all, this is no ordinary "comeback". This is a man that was among the best high school sprinters/hurdlers in the country (10.36/13.66) when he graduated in 2000 (= #4 in both events). He then went to the University of Tennessee where he won back to back NCAA sprint doubles as a frosh/soph and set a National Collegiate Record for 200 meters (19.86). He then went pro and following injury in his first pro season came back to win the Olympic 100 meter title in Athens (9.85) and then a sprint double in Helsinki (9.88/20.00) in very inclement weather. The follow up was an equaling of the then WR of 9.77 for 100 meters early the next season.
Biologists generally agree, however that one feature above all others defines the orchid and differentiates it from virtually all other flowering plants - the fusion of the male portion of the flower (stamens) and the female portion (pistils). Orchid flowers are pollinated by a great variety of flying animals, and their diversity in floral structure has resulted from adaptations to various pollinators. About half the orchid species are pollinated by bees; moths, butterflies, flies, birds, and other agents pollinate the rest. Many orchid flowers are adapted for pollination by a single species of insect.

Another thing worth noting...aside from affirmative action bonus points, the president was the grandson of a bank president who raised him and paid his fees at the exclusive Punahou School in Hawaii..and Michelle Obama's father was a well connected Democrat ward leader, with all that entails.

Although Chary ended up getting sick early Sunday morning I would have to say the trip was very enjoyable for everyone. I surely don't get to see Grandiose, Frisuer, and Chary nearly enough so I greatly cherish the opportunities I do get with them. I am very hopeful that Grandiose is able to make a trip up for a regular season game when the tailgating is in full force along with all of the great traditions that take place before each and every home game at Notre Dame. I am sure Frisuer and Chary will remember the experience as well. I hope to do this again next year as well, but we will have to see if we are able to make it work out again for everyone.
For those tasks that could very well carry you through the night, you need to realise that somethings are better left for the next day if they are beyond reasonable to accomplish today. You will normally find that doing so will produce a better result anyway as you will be better focused and will have had time to re-energise.
The cream of Rutland society is mingling with the great and good of the Liberal Democrats. On the stairs, the elves of Rockingham Forest are attempting to share a joke with Sarah Teather. Through the French windows I can see Meadowcroft chasing stray guests off his lawn with a broom.
Last week he took his two-man crew downstairs and they tore out the knotty pine paneling on the outside backyard wall, took up all the 1970's basement shag carpeting, tore down the ceiling tiles (which had been falling down on a regular basis anyway) and moved in a dumpster to get rid of the debris.

I'm not saying every Christian should have voted for Barack Obama. However, I am saying that nobody should vote for a candidate because of a single issue, especially such a complicated issue such as abortion.

Rajoy's Popular Party - give him his due, it's a great name - has deepened fiscal austerity, reformed Spain's labour market, and ordered banks to set aside an extra 54bn of bad loan provisions and capital buffers this year. But the banks have now somewhat sheepishly come back to say that's about a third of what they need. That's worrying, because translating bankspeak into English, it probably means it's about 5% of what they need.

The story line is straightforward and simple and the newlyweds in real life Riteish Deshmukh and Genelia D'Souza do form an endearing pair on screen as well. Genelia scores simply by underplaying her ebullience. Well suited for the role of the gutsy, bindaas female lead requirement, she has successfully overcome the temptation to display her teeth in every scene of the movie. It may still require her more time and effort to match the histrionics of what Kareena Kapoor managed to achieve in the portrayal of a similar character in JAB WE MET, but if she works on her dialogue delivery and attempting more changes to her facial expressions depending on the requirement of the scene, she will certainly leave a mark.

As things stand at the moment, it is the prevailing view within the Church of England that -- to adopt a minimalist position -- God's Word on the subject of marriage is relatively clear. If there is dissent from that view in the congregation, it is therefore surely the task of the teaching office to correct it.

And in the meantime, since I can't build a Time Machine and go back to school and get a different degree, I spend some of my time trying to get as much education as I can on subjects about communication and language as I try to understand why my son has such a problem with his.

And where does a bug like this come from? The part of the program appears completely unchanged to me. Why would something that worked fine in the prior version and is apparently unchanged suddenly have a bug? A million to one shot based on my configuration? I guess I'll never know. But if Intuit suddenly decides to send me a fat check for my time, I certainly won't complain. (Hint, hint.)
Let's examine the second half of the video. One protester calls out 'Mic check!,' and everyone knows what this means. This guy will speak for us, he has something to say. And if they disagree, they can simply stop passing this person's words along. But in this case he speaks words of de-escalation. We will let you police leave. He's teaching the police a lesson in non-violence. It's amazing to see this at work.

The race organisers couldn't help the weather, but there was a lot throughout the day which showed that given the warning they had about the likelihood of poor weather, they could have performed a whole heap better than they did. This became abundantly clear from the start as only one entrance to the stadium was open though two were advertised in the programme - this meant all runners trying to get in and out through one gate. Pandemonium. At about this time - still with half an hour to go - organisers were trying to chivee everyone out of the stadium to start lining up at the start in the cold and wet.

The aroma was filled with the recognizable smell of Smith and Cross: strong, funky and full of promise. Of course the molasses was there as well, though I am still not sure if I was smelling the actual molasses or the Smith and Cross. Also, the pineapple spear, which was an utter garnish failure, awkward protuberance that it was, added a bit of undefinable fruitiness to the nose. The first sip was very molasses-y, though the hogo of the rum carried through at the end. You would think that there would be some sweetness in this drink, but it was dry and earthy, with a vague powdery texture that made each sip seem almost chewy. After I increased the bitters, the spices became more detectable on the swallow. The flavors of the molasses were also enhanced by the increase in bitters--the drink seemed sweeter, in that pleasing molasses cookie way, and the flavors in general seemed more balanced. Overall, not bad but not great.

That's it. There aren't really any short cuts. People always want short cuts. New acts often want to know how to get an agent. The chances are that any act asking how to get an agent doesn't really need an agent. And when they're at a stage where an agent can help them, they'll find there are agents there offering to help. That's how it works.

This film is crazy but there is streak of dark humour running through it all. Rupert Everett narrates Francesco's thoughts throughout the film, including his meditations on the meaning of life death and love. Francesco is never a nice person but I don't get this modern obsession with creating likeable protagonists. I love this film and I know other people may not.

Even more importantly I think I'm having a rebirth of my spirit. For the longest time I've basically just existed. I've done the bare minimum around the house. It's been a struggle to get that done too. But the last few weeks I've been WANTING to spread my wings and take the time to make the homemade breads and the homemade snacks. I've been wanting to do that stuff. It's almost like I'm being reborn. I don't know what has brought this about. I'm afraid to blink...afraid that it will go away if I do. I still have all the stress and depression in my life....but I'm really trying to not let it affect ME. And maybe that's the whole difference.

WEALTHY FAMILIES: The first is wealthy families where the older generation has retired or is nearing retirement. Typically, their income is secure and they're concerned primarily with wealth protection and transfer. Agents may find that these wealthy families can take underutilized or under-performing assets and convert them to a permanent life insurance policy, often with the added advantage of a LTC rider. This strategy helps secure their wealth and makes it possible to pass on their assets to heirs in a tax-advantaged way, as well as assuring their long-term security if they need care.

On occasion, a licensee is permitted to buy machinery from a third party based on the licensed patents and/or know-how.

In his opening remarks, Bloomberg cited his enthusiasm for the arena and "a lot of economic growth, more tax revenues and more jobs." That of course is a bit more complicated.

You might notice the poll in the top left corner. I'm starting a book club! If you're interested, tune back in on Wednesday when we take on the fun challenge of choosing our first book!
What is one book everyone should read?
For those tasks that could very well carry you through the night, you need to realise that somethings are better left for the next day if they are beyond reasonable to accomplish today. You will normally find that doing so will produce a better result anyway as you will be better focused and will have had time to re-energise.
HUNTINGTON: There are episodes where it's heavier.
Then Tyson turned around and I noticed something.
The guru, or acaryadeva, as we learn from the bona fide scriptures, delivers the message of the absolute world, the transcendental abode of the Absolute Personality, where everything nondifferentially serves the Absolute Truth. We have heard so many times: mahajano yena gata sa pantha ("Traverse the trail which your previous acarya has passed"), but we have hardly tried to understand the real purport of this sloka. If we scrutinizingly study this proposition, we understand that the mahajana is one, and the royal road to the transcendental world is also one. In the Muaka Upaniad (1.2.12) it is said:
You were given to me by my second oldest sister back in the days when I was not such a food nerd. I bet you were just a $15-$20 product, but I felt like I was on the road to cooking awesome food when I unwrapped your box. (It was Christmas, I think.) You only had a two year warranty, and, to be honest, I didn't think you'd last past it.
So when is all of this stuff going to be pressed into service to make beer? Well, that's a question best answered by the folks at Flying Fish (they say test brewing could start in May). But whenever that day comes, to quote Dr. Emmet Brown, "you're gonna see some serious shit."
You are transformed into a world where rolling hills, sprawling vineyards, beautiful houses, and quaint villages take over. From lunch with a traditional Italian family to cooking pasta, visiting shops selling ham, cured meats and cheese, tasting wines and visiting a local factory making pasta, Antonio and Gennaro keeps you entertained with their wit and humour in Bologna- their first stop. Next they move on to the South of Italy to the Amalfi coast, where Gennaro grew up. Personally this was the most favourite episode for me. Cooking by the sea side, plucking fresh lemons off the trees and biting into them, preparing a linguine dish on a boat using fresh octopus and mussels which Gennaro collected after his diving expedition and the wit and humour the two Italians share among themselves were absolutely fun to watch. Ah! the ricotta and lemon tart they made in this episode still holds fresh in my memory. Its high up there on my to-make list.
In his opening remarks, Bloomberg cited his enthusiasm for the arena and "a lot of economic growth, more tax revenues and more jobs." That of course is a bit more complicated.

'No,' I say, 'But that's a good guess. It shows me you know the Romans had no electricity. Well done!'
I went to the front desk and explained what happened and luckily they did give us a room (it would have been a long trip home!). We got the same type of room, same rate, but it was a handicapped accessible room. They probably hold those rooms back in case they are needed. I don't know yet if I got charged for our missed night. I had reserved the room with a card that I subsequently canceled (due to fraud). So I don't know if they would have been able to charge it or not.

"I'm for Mitt Romney," the former president said Tuesday as the doors of his elevator shut, perhaps his only statement of public opinion on the race before the Nov. 6 election.

Mendy, as much as I, found this almost too good to be true and a bit hard to believe, even though all sorts of wonderful beings show up in her office all the time. As she said later, though, she has a great deal of experience with this stuff and she feels confident of being able to sniff out a fraud. Stephen did not appear to be a fraud, not to either of us. I had a feeling of the sublime, no sense of anything that might raise an alarm.

What if they were to do a study to report a finding of clinically obese people who'd take a year or more off their lives for a "perfect" body? Or people with some sort of birth defect? Or - and perhaps most pertinent to my own situation - transsexuals?
Respect your partnership with providence.
So end our readers' tributes to Hitch. As I expect many of you have been doing, I've spent quite a few hours over the last two weeks watching videos of Christopher in debate, giving talks, or taking down pompous talking heads on television. I could recommend my favorites, but suggest instead that you just find a random one and follow the YouTube links. You will be impressed: for someone who talked so often, he rarely repeated himself, and everything he said sounded fresh. We have nobody to replace this man, but, thank Ceiling Cat, he left us a legacy of not only his writings and the example of his courage, but also the visual record of his eloquence and incessant fight for the truth.
That said, I don't overly fret dating a story. I don't think you can write convincing contemporary settings without occasionally taking that risk.
So, adoptive families must be more exact with their questions, since many of them probably would argue that baby-buying is corruption. Instead of asking, "Do you feel there is wide-spread corruption in China's program?" a better question might be "Do you feel that paying substantial amounts of money for children is adoption corruption? And how wide-spread do you feel this baby-buying is?" It may be that he hedges, like the villager in the opening story, out of a reluctance to air China's dirty laundry, for there is one characteristic of the Chinese that I understand very well, having lived with one for seven years: The Chinese do not like to reveal the dirty secrets of their country, even to friends. It is a tradition and understanding that goes back hundreds of years. We might view it as lying, but the Chinese consider it "saving face."

It's also not clear how much we should cheer the 64.6 percent increase in the number of Black-owned non-employer firms. Average revenues at these firms dropped 10.7 percent in real terms between 2002 and 2007. Perhaps more importantly, in 2007 the average revenue at a Black-owned non-employer firm was only $18,500 (in 2002 dollars).

Here it is. The real purpose of the visit to Pho 68. Pho with rare beef and braised beef. It looked the part, and tasted it too. They've got the makings of a really good pho here. The stock was excellent. Deep, aromatic and intensely savoury. Wafer thin slices of beef were rare on arrival but cooked through as time progressed, the gentle poaching keeping them tender. The braised beef (brisket I think) was also sliced thin, but had a stronger, minerally flavour. The tendon running through it was soft and gelatinous speaking of long, slow cooking. The noodles, save for a little gluey clump at the top, were cooked just right.

The story revolves around Vyme a mechanic at the star pit where ships are repaired. He tries to help out young people that want to work in the repair shops. One is Ratit. It seems Vyme misses his own group family and his kids. He has a drinking problem and that alienated him from everyone.
Covey amplifies his message by means of wide-ranging examples of "third alternative thinkers". There's the local police force that transformed a crime-plagued community by casting off its entrenched "them against us" mentality. Another example tells the tale of a father who, during the course of one extraordinary evening, rescued his daughter from years of clinical depression. Then there's the judge who brought a swift and peaceful end to a massive environmental lawsuit without setting foot in a courtroom.
Here´s how this would work: in real life, I would never introduce you to my sister because you might like her more than you like me and that would not be my preferred cuppa.
I used paper from My Minds Eye-Playful Posies paper stack. I cut the shape at 4.39 x 9.66 using my gypsy to weld the shape together. The frame layer is cut at 4.39 x 4.91 which I embossed with the polka dots folder. I distressed the edges with Tim Holtz distress ink-old paper.
Writing stories of such a concise length makes you think about the importance of every single word, and is a great exercise to improve your writing skills. So get thinking and get writing. And whilst you're at it, get looking at the official National Flash-Fiction Competition.
What spacecraft, what weapon
The point of cleavage between those who hold the crude theory of Baptismal regeneration, ex opere operato, and those who maintain what is usually spoken of as the "Hypothetical Theory," lies just here. The former believe that the recital of a formula and the performance of a particular action necessarily produce the spiritual effect of regeneration; the latter hold that where believing prayer is offered for a blessing, which we have reason to believe it is God's will to grant, that prayer will be provisionally answered. The former believe that this spiritual result is absolute, and admits of being neither reversed nor supplemented; the latter maintain that the result, whatever it is, must needs be provisional in its character, and cannot be made absolute until the condition upon which in the case of an adult it is contingent is complied with. The former maintain that the saving effect of this ordinance may be lost by wilful sin; the latter maintain that such saving effects only remain if the condition on which they are contingent is complied with, and, even where wilful sin does not occur, are forfeited by the non-fulfilment of the appointed condition. According to the former theory, no baptized member of our congregations needs to be born again, or, indeed, can be, although his life may be a discredit to our common humanity, and it would seem that the only hope for him lay in the possibility of so radical a change ; according to the other, all who have never consciously exercised faith in the special promise of God made in Baptism need to be told, "Ye must be born again." The difference between the two positions, which may seem to be slight, is really radical. The Gorham judgment given on appeal by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council affirmed that the hypothetical explanation of the formularies of the Church of England was a perfectly reasonable and legitimate one, though it did not affirm that it was the only possible interpretation. See GORHAM CASE.
Liverworts, like mosses contain no vascular systems to transport water and nutrients throughout the plant. This means they are most likely to be found in damp shady locations. Not surprisingly, wherever you find liverworts, there is bound to be mosses as well. Although liverwort like shade, they also require enough sunlight to conduct photosynthesis.
The day of the big dance, the twins are instructed to clean their rooms and while doing so, Elizabeth discovers George's letter to Enid. Using her mad Jessica Fletcher skillz, she finally deducts that it was her unhinged sister that told Ronnie about George. Of course, instead of confronting her like a normal person, Elizabeth begins to plot her revenge. Seeing as the last book established her unique brand of crap vengeance, she's probably just planning to hide Jessica's hairbrush or something.
The bike training that the children are doing came next, Herr B couldn't resist the opportunity to comment that some of the bikes (that'll be 2 English kids then at least) don't have kick down bike stands and have to be leant up against the wall, damn! Good job schools have walls eh? I refuse as a matter of principle to put a bike stand on Jas's bike (sorry Jas) and if next year when the local cop in charge of bike testing doesn't pass the bike because of it's lack of a stand then so be it, to date there's no legal requirement for bikes to have stands to make them roadworthy therefore our bikes will be standless and I shall stand my ground on that one.

Personally, I am a fan of books like this that help bridge the gap to help children graduate from reading Bible picture books to actually digesting Scripture. And while it is not a homeschool "curriculum", it would certainly adapt well as a Bible curriculum, especially if your family enjoys the New Living Translation. On the other hand, children this age are incredibly impressionable. They are thinking and absorbing so much. It is time to sharpen up on your theology. I have read some Bible storybooks where the stories are retold in a way that uses soft theology or even sways the story by adding (or omitting) details to the original text. The mere fact that someone picks and chooses only certain Bible stories to retell means that the person has at least some control of what the final presentation looks like. In this book, Carolyn Larsen has condensed the Scripture to retell each story, but (as you can see from the one example above) she is merely eliminating details that may cause a young brain (or even my old brain) to scatter and wander. It brings the story focus, and keeps the truth. Larsen has taken the opportunity to use the "Now What" section to tie in the big picture of the Gospel right from the beginning. For me, this is an essential element that I look for in a good book. One of the first things I did was flip to the back of the book to the stories telling of Jesus' death and resurrection and the early church. I read through the "Now What" sections looking for any details that may tell my child how or why to become saved. At first, it appeared that I wouldn't find what I was looking for. Disappointed, I flipped to Genesis. There it was. With the telling of Adam and Eve's sin, came the Gospel. Right at the beginning, exactly where it was needed. We need a Savior and here's why and here is where you can find Him.

Dad went for a walk around when we got there and mum and i got the boys into their swimmers. Then Jordy was straight in the river and wanting to go floating off downstream. Mum had Darcy and i was still getting ready to get in and Jordy is off! Little bugger. I was a bit worried about him going over the edge of the waterfall but i met him down the end and he kicked over to me. Not that it was a big waterfall! He would not have been hurt if he went over but he might have scared himself.

Montana is the latest establishment in the ever-growing stable of cool-kid haunts owned and operated by Paris graffiti artist-turned-entrepreneur, Monsieur André. He's made a packet for himself by buying up interesting old bars and turning them into dens of beautiful-people iniquity. He launched his Paris bar empire with Le Baron, in the 8th arrondissement, a former brothel that, about four years ago became the place to see, be seen and dance ironically to hits of the 80s.

Not everyone is a fan of Valentine's Day, and although I'm one of those as well, I just want to be clear that unlike my last book, Fractured Facade, this short story is not about me. Well, some "elements" of the tale are based on true life experiences, but not necessarily mine.
My kids clean up FAST. They know how to clean and when told to do so, man can they really get the job done.
What I have not found is any evidence that the motive for farm murders is "genocide". The perpetrators are sometimes caught, tried and convicted. In how many of these cases has the motive been proved to be "genocide"? If the genocide propagandists can show that this morive has been proved in the majority of cases (a 51% majority will do), then I will be prepared to take their contentions seriously. But until they do that, I will take their assertions with several bags of salt, and merely white racist propaganda. Sannie sê Sannie sal sewe sakke sout sleep.

-Kairo: A game about exploring massive, strange spaces and solving massive strange puzzles. It's. I don't know. If you're like me you're at half-mast just from the description. It's all well and good to shit on Myst and everything, but I just have a real love of exploring strange spaces. STALKER, for instance, was less about shooting shit for me and more about finding weird old soviet structures warped by strange radiation. Same with Fallout. Looking at something in the distance and finding out why it's there is just super cool. Like archaeology but with the boring edited out.
"What do you mean Penfold?"
Once you have your paper cut out in the size you want, I generally use my Xacto knife to score my folds (very gently, I really don't even push, just drag the blade gently across the paper). I score the "pretty side" of my paper, not the back. A ruler helps to keep your lines straight, if you don't trust yourself scoring the paper, you can also line up your ruler and fold against it to keep your folds crisp.
TMT, developed over 20 years ago by social psychologists, explains how humans come to cope with death anxiety by developing self-esteem and attributing purpose to life. However, we do this by shoring up our own cultural identities, self-esteem, and frankly become more conservative in the way that we view others who might threaten our world view. So while Dark Tourism might make us feel all the better about being alive, it may make us less tolerant of others which just seems so counter-intuitive.

Scientists at Rothamsted are trialling a variety of GM wheat that produces a pheromone that aphids don't like. Aphids eat wheat, and reduce crop yields. If you can stop them from going near the wheat, then the yields should be higher. As a pre-emptive strike, I'm going to point out that the gene added to the wheat occurs naturally in many species of plant. It is not, as has been said, a 'cow gene'.

Biologists generally agree, however that one feature above all others defines the orchid and differentiates it from virtually all other flowering plants - the fusion of the male portion of the flower (stamens) and the female portion (pistils). Orchid flowers are pollinated by a great variety of flying animals, and their diversity in floral structure has resulted from adaptations to various pollinators. About half the orchid species are pollinated by bees; moths, butterflies, flies, birds, and other agents pollinate the rest. Many orchid flowers are adapted for pollination by a single species of insect.

Because that's how blogging works: I offer an endless supply of overshared details from my personal life and you voyeuristically consume them. Duh. And let's face it, this ain't Fifty Shades of Grey I'm living out here in the exurbs, either. Sometimes the most exciting thing that happens involves wire, mesh and a recalcitrant dishwasher named Paco.
And so I began. I used the instructions I found online as my chief guide but after three days I was a little skeptical that the sour dough had fermented enough or produced enough yeast. My Twitter friend Finn said that he had been feeding his starter ("Veruca") for 12 days and it was now time. So I asked him if he thought my starter was ready? He confirmed what I thought and said no. So I've been letting "Finn Jr". grow and grow. Last night he became a rebellious teenager and we woke up to him trying to escape the safety of his jar to explore the world (thus the picture above this posting).

Note: don't expect the dough to rise during this period - remember, it's not a yeast bread, and by definition unleavened ('chappa' means flattened in Tamil). I assumed this was more of a "rest" period for the gluten and what not in the flours to react with the water. Other chapati recipes online, however, don't include the hour rest period, so if you're in a rush I'm tempted to say you could skip it.

On days that I need to complete a lot I will set my timer for 15 minutes and work on one task for the full 15 minutes. I will stop that task when the timer goes off and move on to another task. This usually happens on good days, where the pain is tolerable. I will work on one task, for example, clearing clutter in one room, then I move to 15 minutes doing computer work, then 15 minutes cleaning a focus zone, then 15 minutes reading. I try to alternate from something physical to something sedentary, and including a 15 minute "break" every third 15 minute session. This is what I call my 15 minute day, and I find that I am most productive these days.

Keep the Chinese New Year theme going. Bang on a drum by your snow fire. Grab whatever makes a ruckus and traipse through your house, making as much noise as possible. This is a great way to chase away bad luck and make room for good fortune. You can also clean your house for the New Year, but that's not quite as fun.

After compiling a passel of such non-animation and not exclusively cartoon images, I have decided to launch them on their own blog: "Pacific SplendorLAnd", where they will not interfere with the winnowing but still vaguely animation-related ramblings here.The main thing I have enjoyed about doing these pieces is that they wind up being singular, self-contained compositions, as opposed to quick fragmented doodles on the one end of the spectrum; or artwork created as a stream of storytelling devices, such as a storyboard or an animation sequence on the other. So somehow this makes them want their own blog.

Monday, February 8th was a great night. We had pizza at A Slice of Brooklyn and then we made a presentation at the 77th Precinct Community Council meeting. There were a lot of people - probably over 50. I was a little nervous because I have never done a presentation outside of school before. But, come to find out it was great and me and the other students did well.
I do agree that the overgrown man-child figure in films can be very annoying, but I also don't like the fact we live an a society that worships 'maturity.' Yes, it's important that adults should be capable of earning money, supporting themselves and not behaving like pre-socialisation children (there's a reason all our parents/caregivers taught us the lesson 'If you aren't nice, people won't like you.' Because, seriously, they won't). Note that I said 'capable' - sadly in today's economy, too many people can't do some of these things, through no fault of their own, or temporarily choose not to, to pursue other goals.

Kaputt is a total curveball from an artist who had previously been in danger of settling too comfortably into a familiar style. Dan Bejar's albums as Destroyer had been yielding diminishing returns in recent years, and it had begun to seem like he was going to keep mining the same basic territory until everyone who once loved his quirky, urbane, complex pop grew bored of the stagnation. Instead, he's turned to an out-of-favor style from the past, swathing his songs in reverb-heavy lite-jazz and balearic pop atmospheres, recalling the crude synth presets and shimmering, plastic production of early 80s radio pop. It's a daring reinvention, and what initially might seem like a gimmick soon reveals itself, over multiple listens, as a brilliant aesthetic maneuver. Bejar's usually spiky voice is smoothed out to fit the glistening musical backdrops, and the album glides by so effortlessly that Bejar's characteristic wit has a chance to sneak up on the listener for once. The music is sad and sweet, and there's a lonely nostalgic feeling built into Bejar's trip to the musical past. Horns echo within the mix, surrounded with reverb to impart a feeling of distance, as though the trumpeter is miles away, intoning lonely notes into a void. Bejar is taking music often thought of as kitschy and dated and reconstructing it as haunting downer pop, revealing the loneliness and emptiness lurking behind the party gloss and disco gleam. Because of the subtlety of it all, and the initial impression of surface slickness, it's a real grower of an album that only parcels out its secrets slowly, gradually accumulating emotional depth and intensity until the kitschy surface style seems like the most natural possible way of capturing these dark, secret feelings.

And then left a little more to the left to our wall of windows: master bedroom, family room, and sun room, the last of which houses our casual dining table and JP's new home office. He may be tired of talking on the phone 10 hours a day, but there's no doubt his view is much improved from his old windowless cubicle.
Come Saturday, no matter what, I WILL be back in the craft room making a card .... any card ... even a one-layer-card. It may take extra effort to find all the needed supplies since everything is just tossed willy-nilly in there, but I refuse to go another weekend without crafting in my own space. So that will be my end goal for this week: make one card in remodeled craft room. How hard that that be? Really? LOL LOL

Audition candidates should be female dancers between the ages of 16 - 22 years of age and 5'4" tall or under, with classical ballet training. Those auditioning should be prepared to dance en pointe with a solo piece. Dancers may bring along music on CDs to dance to, if they wish to do so, but this is not required. Audition candidates should be prepared to partner that day and to stay for Call Backs. Audition candidates should bring three copies of their headshots and three copies of their biographies to the audition.
What ought to be acutely troubling is that the history of revisions to oil and gas resources has heretofore been one of increases. For the first time, we are now seeing not just downward revisions in estimated natural gas resources, but drastic downward revisions. That should tell us that the era of unlimited horizons for fossil fuels has come to a close. All the advanced technology that was supposed to bring unending plenty in the form of fossil fuels is now giving us better estimates of what will be available, namely, not nearly so much as we thought.

Written for ages 6 and older this is one of many delightful books in the Katie Woo series. I no longer have children or grandchildren this age but the title reminded me of my 8-year-old granddaughter (kind of a Madame Fullcharge) and I thought she and I would have fun reading it together. She wasn't interested. Said it was too young for her. That might be because she just finishing up her 4th grade brothers book, Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief. Anyway I thought the book was great and I still think she would have enjoyed it. I'll bet if I could have figured out how to get it onto Kindle she may have read it.

And then there was the wind! The picture above shows the backyard of our son after the storm. That heavy propane grill was blown over - it took two of us to put it back. If you look carefully at the picture above (it can be enlarged), you'll see the leg of a chair that went through their fence. It was later reported that a tornado touched down a couple of miles from their house - I'm glad we didn't know about that at the time!

That view, of connections to one another, could have begun in the ancient Jewish belief of blessings and cursings. The translators of Christ's words may have been a bit leery of the idea of cursing someone. "Blessed are the meek" was fine. But cursing the un-meek? Did they change the words so that we read now the easier-to-digest "woe unto him"? As in, perhaps, "woe unto him who hurts the least of these, the children." . Sounds safe enough until you realize this may be an example of the Jewish belief in cursing someone, in proclaiming your hope in his receiving his just desserts for a particular behavior. Pedophilia, anyone?

I turned to my computer, salivating at the thought of entertainment. Clicking the internet icon brought a window up just like that. I began to type, each letter appearing near the top of my screen. Within seconds I should be entertained, I thought as I hit enter.
But why are there so few older women in television anyway? I considered the roles for women over 35 in shows that I watch. You'll have to pardon my lack of reality television knowledge, so feel free to fill me in on older women in any of those shows. Also, I am aware that these are all dramas.
I can tell you how NOT to go about things. One, clean yourself and your truck up. If I were to have land and Homeboy showed up in his 4X4 with dog boxes and a bumper sticker that read "Hog Hunters Do It In The Brush" I'll probably call the cops. Think about that, seriously. The South is known for its rednecks, but that sorta thing won't garner positive attention.
Despite the horrid waste of taxpayer's money on the various green energy firms that keep failing, Obama blamed the Solyndra debacle on the Chinese who "were subsidizing their solar industry and flooding the market in ways that Solyndra couldn't compete." That was well known before the Solyndra half billion dollar loan guarantee was made, followed by still more to other solar companies.

Although Emily knows her math facts fairly well, she could stand to improve her speed, so I was interested to see how Math Rider would stack up against other programs we've tried. It teaches mastery of all 4 math operations with numbers 1-12 and is designed for children ages 6-12. To play, the child begins a "quest." A short story scenario is given, then the child rides his or her horse, "Shadow," across deserts, mountains, and so on. Math problems appear at the bottom of the screen. As the problem is answered, the horse jumps over an obstacle. If the problem is missed, the horse stops while the game gives the correct answer. The problems and speed are adjusted to the child's abilities, with problems the child has trouble with generated more frequently.

14. Changes to the law of this kind should not be driven by public opinion but by serious informed debate. Public opinion polls can be easily manipulated when high media profile (and often celebrity-driven) 'hard cases' are used to elicit emotional reflex responses without consideration of the strong arguments against legalisation.
Because that's how blogging works: I offer an endless supply of overshared details from my personal life and you voyeuristically consume them. Duh. And let's face it, this ain't Fifty Shades of Grey I'm living out here in the exurbs, either.

We'd decided on going to the Cartoon Museum in London when we read about an exhibition of work by one of the greatest cartoonists of all time, H.M. Bateman. He was the man who pioneered short or no-caption drawings which were such a welcome contrast to the rather heavily laboured pieces favoured by the Edwardians and Victorians. He also did fabulous caricatures, but was best known for his series about 'The Man Who.', which included toe-curling embarrassing moments, such as a guardsman who dropped his rifle on parade and a junior officer who ate the colonel's starter at a regimental dinner. He did superb irate older men with popping monocles and incandescent eye-brows. We both laughed outright many times in the exhibition - and nobody went Shhhhh. It's a great place: very cheap to get in, an excellent shop and the show itself was superb: very well-lit and arranged and with full, detailed captions. I can report that the Cartoon Museum hasn't caught the almost universal disease of British museums who seem to think their visitors are either ill-informed half-wits, or pre-school children.
Friday night we had dinner at Renaldi's on Lincoln, which was perfectly kid friendly and easy! After dinner we went back to Courtney's house for wine and bonding. Courtney has an adorable new apartment in Lincoln Park were the group stayed for the weekend.

After making use of a convenient tree-stump chair (carved in situ by a friendly forester), I continue northwards towards Riding Bottom. On the left, more clear-felled pines, very recent judging by the greenness of the snedded branches and freshness of the chips spewed out by the chainsaw. On the right, by contrast, another low stone wall, topped with smoothly serpentine roots and limbs of beech, the boundary of Riding Copse beyond.

The trail ends at the Atlantic & Yadkin Greenway, not far from Lake Brandt Road. By turning right, you can follow the Greenway back to Bur-Mil Park for a five-mile loop. The Owls Roosts Trail also offers an additional 1.25 miles of trail along a service road and an official shortcut that links the sections along the northern and southern arms of the lake.

Butterflies tasting the delights of spring
Hmm where do I start from? where? where? where.? Oh yeah, there!. So I'm quite certain that every believer knows what "New Creation" means (at least I hope so). When asked to define the term, words like "born-again", "salvation", "repentance", "baptism" etc are bound to be used in the definition. That's all good but who really is the "NEW CREATURE"? The creation story helped me understand this better so let's start from there. Once upon a time, God created man (and woman), gave him authority over everything on earth (Genesis 1:27-31) and placed him in the Garden of Eden where man could be close to HIM (GOD) all the time. One day, the enemy of God (and all God's children), satan, tricked man into sinning against God. Satan gave man "sin and the pleasures that come with it" and in return man gave up his authority over earth and everything in it, hence, man came under the rulership of satan. Uhmm.. yeah I guess you can call it an exchange. satan brought sin to man and man paid with his authority over the earth. A poor exchange indeed.but hey, it was no robbery. Anyway, satan, having all the authority now, become the ruler of man; and man the slave of satan (Jesus replied, "Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin" John 8:32). Man was forever doomed as a slave of the enemy and like anyone who is sentenced to life imprisonment without appeal, the only way of escape is DEATH. Scary huh? I know! Well, God who created man and loved man in spite of man's disobedience wanted to free His creation from bondage so He had to send no one else but LIFE to set man free. The Son of God, JESUS CHRIST is LIFE (Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the LIFE.John 14:6; "In him was LIFE.John 1:4). JESUS was/is the only ONE who can set man free.WHY? Think of it this way. Man's only hope of escaping the slavery of satan is death and we all know everyone dies but once. You have one chance to live and after that, there is death and judgement etc. God couldn't watch man die in his sins so there had to be another way to set man free and that way is JESUS. Jesus came on the earth as a man, suffered and died.but uh huh, that's the best part. He died not just for dying sake but He died so He could defeat DEATH. He had to defeat death so He could give man a second chance to life. For 3 days He was dead but on the 3rd day, He rose again having won POWER over death."..Whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have EVERLASTING life" John 3:16. Everlasting life is possible in Jesus because He holds both the power of LIFE (because He is LIFE) and DEATH(because He defeated death) in His hands. Any man who then believes in Him is set free from slavery through death but is given another chance to live and is given a NEW LIFE. Jesus creates the old slave who died anew and breathes LIFE again into his nostrils to make him a living soul.(Then the LORD God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being: Genesis 2:7). This is why anyone who is born-again/born in Christ is said to be a NEW CREATURE (Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new: 2 Corinthians 5:17). Just like the first man ever created, the NEW CREATURE is not placed back on in the world he just got freed from, he is placed into a world, a place, a kingdom where he can be close to God again. The NEW CREATURE no longer belongs to the world of sin and slavery (.because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you- John 15:19). The blessings and authority (Gen. 1:28-31) man God first gave to man before the fall is returned to the NEW CREATURE who becomes part of the body of Christ (.and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all- Ephe. 1:20-23). Yup! Not only does the NEW YOU receive freedom and salvation in CHRIST, but you also receive power and authority over satan and his followers. So now you know.The "NEW YOU" who is born in CHRIST is more powerful and more important than can be comprehended. YOU are God's own precious POSSESSION bought at a very high price. YOU are PRICELESS as could be. Turn to HIS WORD to fully know the "NEW YOU" He created.
Im a few hours late in posting, I had to start and finish my Christmas shopping last night when Jas got home home from work.

Sort of the flip side of the last post when I was wondering what we should commit ourselves to crafting as a group. What do you think you is worth some money in the Station Cash Store? What should we consider buying?
I used paper from My Minds Eye-Playful Posies paper stack. I cut the shape at 4.39 x 9.66 using my gypsy to weld the shape together. The frame layer is cut at 4.39 x 4.91 which I embossed with the polka dots folder. I distressed the edges with Tim Holtz distress ink-old paper.
OK here it is
While the first narrative was about people who had a multitude of reasons to not be happy, the second one could've almost been a fairytale. Here we meet Antoine (Kevin Parent) a middle-aged DJ who is living an enviable life raising two gorgeous daughters with his equally pretty girlfriend (Evelyne Brochu). But life is not always a bed of roses because he still thinks of his ex-wife (Hélène Florent), his first love and original soul mate.
Anyone who has sung in a cathedral choir in Britain or Ireland will know and love Stanford's church music, which set a standard and started a vigorous tradition what extended almost to the present day. But what I am uploading is one of his piano concertos, played with great verve by the young Irish pianist Finghin Collins. It's classic Stanford - you can hear a nod to Rachmaninoff in the first movement, but the bluff, muscular energy is very much Stanford. I played the first piano quartet a while back, and you notice the same thing - you have to dig into the music from bar one (literally for the strings, who have a wonderful flourish to open the work).

You know how sometimes you just feel grouchy as all get-out? For no reason? Sure, if you're female and somewhere between puberty and the end of menopause, you can blame it on hormones. Actually, you can blame it on hormones at any time--even if you're a guy. "It's andropause! I swear! I didn't mean to shoot your truck!"

Let's examine the second half of the video. One protester calls out 'Mic check!,' and everyone knows what this means. This guy will speak for us, he has something to say. And if they disagree, they can simply stop passing this person's words along. But in this case he speaks words of de-escalation. We will let you police leave. He's teaching the police a lesson in non-violence. It's amazing to see this at work.
Pat colored this lovely frog more times than you can imagine today. Here's one of her little green friends that I managed to catch on camera before it hoped away. This frog was colored with light green, shaded with dark green, then Pat dabbed some colorless blender onto a rag and added the fine texture.
"Officer," Chris said, "can you aim your light up on that roof?" The officer turned the beam to the roof and searched. "There's a dark spot on the right side. See it? About two feet wide?"
JS - How badly prepared has the SPL been for this eventuality? Should it have foreseen this eventuality or is this something you think has emerged from, I mean, not too many people probably a number of years ago would have thought Rangers might be a club that would face potential administration and further potential liquidation. Has the SPL been well enough prepared for this eventuality?
I remember when my babies were born I would hold them and stare at them for hours. I would study every facet of their face every day. It was such a joyous time to bond with them and appreciate every miraculous thing about them. They were beautiful, amazing little beings and I could stare at them forever.
4. Middle Recovery - Lifestyle Balance 5
On days that I need to complete a lot I will set my timer for 15 minutes and work on one task for the full 15 minutes. I will stop that task when the timer goes off and move on to another task. This usually happens on good days, where the pain is tolerable. I will work on one task, for example, clearing clutter in one room, then I move to 15 minutes doing computer work, then 15 minutes cleaning a focus zone, then 15 minutes reading. I try to alternate from something physical to something sedentary, and including a 15 minute "break" every third 15 minute session. This is what I call my 15 minute day, and I find that I am most productive these days.
High Priestess Ondelle is convinced by an old proverb that Brigitta is fated to travel to the former home of the Ancients to help her find the answer. But when they get there, they discover that hundreds of years ago, when the faeries were moved north to the protected realm, some faeries were left behind.
The Bush Conspiracy Theory is a Lie. If neither flight was in the air as American Airlines itself has so stated, then numerous 'official versions' of the 'official conspiracy theory' are but a pack of malicious lies. There is, then, probable cause to indict Bush and his co-conspirators for the crimes of mass murder and high treason. See: U. S. Codes, Title 18, Section 2441. That includes every statement made by Bush.

Meet Samantha. But we hardly ever call her that. Mostly, we call her Little D. That's D, for Diva. Because it's all about her. After a long weekend visiting family in Pennsylvania, we came home and adopted her at the humane society. There, she was named Thelma. You can plainly see that name just didn't suit her. (Actually, I wanted to name her Tootsie and the hubby wanted to name her Tarot. Then I jokingly suggested Samantha because she was being a little naughty at the time - she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter. Anyway, I said to my hubby that we should call her Samantha because "naughty girls need love too". Ha. What can I say, I was a teenager in the 80s.)
I did the round twice, went back home and sat down mentally drained. The image of the envelope laying on the street under the merciless tires of fast cars haunted me. Then the other image started to haunt me, that of strangers finding the envelope and depositing the check into their personal bank accounts.

Hamas leader Khaled Mash'al: "The support we got from Sheikh Al-Qaradhawi is different from the support of anybody else, because of his religious status, his status in terms of morale, and his ability to draw the attention of the nation and the world to the issues of the nation, particularly the issue of Palestine. This support was of great value to us, to the Palestinian people, in the first and second Intifadas, and in all matters pertaining to the Palestinian cause. He has publicly declared his support for the resistance factions, unequivocally and without any hesitation or embarrassment, without fawning over anyone. From day one to the present, the sheikh, may Allah reward him, has not hesitate to support the jihad and the resistance, and to support the fighters, and the resistance factions. One of the most notable manifestations of this support was when we relied - after Allah - on his support of martyrdom operations. He never hesitated to issue rulings in support of these operations, and there were times when we were in dire need of these rulings."
Almost the exact middle, actually. Young and school-trained London singer Woon's debut album, Mirrorwriting, sits between Katy B and James B, pop theatricality and singer-songwriter calm, club culture and bedroom indie, old-school soul and modern electronic R&B, extroverted and introverted. And tying it all together is the language of UK bass. His first major single, 2010's justly lauded "Night Air", announced him as one of a number of young English artists for whom garage, and everything that came after, was just another bit of pop language to use. And from the slow-motion jungle syncopations and muted bass blare of "Street" to the stuttering retro-rave breakbeats that drive "Spirits", the computer-assisted Woon makes sorta-pop from the last 20 years of UK dance the way current U.S. guitar kids draw from surf-rock and girl-groups.

It was a simple chance event on a London underground station that got me thinking about luck, chance and randomness and led many years later to my new novel, Wasted. It wasn't an earth-shattering event but it got me thinking. Obsessively. So, I began a novel for adults - I'd two unpublished ones languishing already - about chance, quantum mechanics, and unpredictability, involving repeated multiple possibilities. The idea was that if there is a god - which I know there isn't - he will either play dice or at least have a lot of fun observing. But halfway through, a completely different idea hit me, this time for teenagers. I abandoned god and quantum

Funny I didn't need that book cause I was entertained the whole time I was in the air. You know you don't want to stare at the other passengers but you do. And you try and not think 'please don't sit by me" but you do. I scored with no babies next to me screaming (although there was an adorable screamer in front of me) . And the nice Scottish man in front of that baby.was so not impressed. The little one thought his head was a play toy. While he kept saying 'ma'am, ma'am' to get Moms attention.Mom and Dad kept slamming back beers and Vodka. We were on our way to Vegas!
Although Chary ended up getting sick early Sunday morning I would have to say the trip was very enjoyable for everyone. I surely don't get to see Grandiose, Frisuer, and Chary nearly enough so I greatly cherish the opportunities I do get with them. I am very hopeful that Grandiose is able to make a trip up for a regular season game when the tailgating is in full force along with all of the great traditions that take place before each and every home game at Notre Dame. I am sure Frisuer and Chary will remember the experience as well. I hope to do this again next year as well, but we will have to see if we are able to make it work out again for everyone.
Perfume: J'Adore l'Or, Dior
While they look beautiful and they did a great job, I regret not taking more time to decide. I had never painted anything before (at the time this was happening) so the thought of painting them myself and having it look professional seemed impossible. But if I had waited 6 months I probably would have had them just add the molding and doors and then we would have done the painting. They used a special kind of paint which makes it look professionally done (like we bought them white) but it's not an easy paint to work with when you need to do touch-ups, and a white kitchen needs lots of touch-ups.
The meal was simple to produce, and lovely to eat.
As for trying two new activities a month, I've decided that one a week would be more fun, and give me an excuse to try to write once a week as well. I'll try to keep that content a little more locally based but the dig in challenge can really be done wherever you are. I don't think it matters where in the world you live, supporting your local economy is important.
All of the above started flying at me through the phone. Remember, she's never even met him or seen the amount of vomit coming out of him.

Emily Cale spent the majority of her childhood as a visitor to the worlds of her favorite authors. With encouragement from her English teachers, she put pen to paper and began imagining her own stories. Preferring the fascinating lives of her characters, she majored in creative writing. When not lost in a manuscript or a good book, she enjoys crocheting, rock climbing, and playing board games. She currently lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with her husband and a very spoiled cat.

Under this provision, one who is not a member of the court at the time an adjudication is made cannot take part in the adjudication. The word "adjudication" means decision. A case can be adjudicated only by means of a decision. And a decision of this Court, to be of value and binding force, must be in writing duly signed and promulgated (Article VIII, sections 11 and 12, of the Constitution; Republic Act No. 296, section 21; Rule 53, section 7, of the Rules of Court). Promulgated means the delivery of the decision to the Clerk of Court for filing and publication.

Have you noticed a difference in people's attitudes toward religious and spiritual expression between rural and urban communities?
Now that a few days have passed, I look back on that Chrysalis weekend with such joy. I don't think about the logistics of it all, I think about how present God was throughout it. With God's help, that weekend was flawless. And as I sat on Sunday listening to these girls talk about how positively affected they were by this weekend.. I knew at that very instant that every bit of sweat and tears was worth it.

An early start for this one at the northern end of Bassenthwaite Lake. There was a heavy mist when I first arrived which slowly lifted. This is twenty minutes from my home so I'm often at the lake's shores with my camera. Very peaceful on this particular morning; did not see a soul.

The truth is, in spite of its colonial history, the Dutch don't do hierarchy - and no more so in business than socially. The Dutch mind-set is not altogether different to Ireland - staunchly strong on family and community - steeped in a history of culture and an attitude that anything can be achieved no matter what the adversity. If we differ in Ireland - it's because we love to feast on adversity and the bad weather and it creates a poetic and spiritual solace, rather than an ability to always move forward and turn what we hold dear into triumph. In the Netherlands, there is no fear of a lack of attachment or going it alone - no matter how small or great the aspiration.

Amanda ate everything after arranging it all neatly on her plate. We didn't get to the pineapple so we'll try that at snack time.

One day he caught me and I tried to listen to his bizarre imaginings. I felt sorry for him. A couple of his teeth were gone. But he was too loud, too edgy, too nonsensical. Never again. He can have my change. But this performance? I don't have the time.
Personally, I am a fan of books like this that help bridge the gap to help children graduate from reading Bible picture books to actually digesting Scripture. And while it is not a homeschool "curriculum", it would certainly adapt well as a Bible curriculum, especially if your family enjoys the New Living Translation. On the other hand, children this age are incredibly impressionable. They are thinking and absorbing so much. It is time to sharpen up on your theology. I have read some Bible storybooks where the stories are retold in a way that uses soft theology or even sways the story by adding (or omitting) details to the original text. The mere fact that someone picks and chooses only certain Bible stories to retell means that the person has at least some control of what the final presentation looks like. In this book, Carolyn Larsen has condensed the Scripture to retell each story, but (as you can see from the one example above) she is merely eliminating details that may cause a young brain (or even my old brain) to scatter and wander. It brings the story focus, and keeps the truth. Larsen has taken the opportunity to use the "Now What" section to tie in the big picture of the Gospel right from the beginning. For me, this is an essential element that I look for in a good book. One of the first things I did was flip to the back of the book to the stories telling of Jesus' death and resurrection and the early church. I read through the "Now What" sections looking for any details that may tell my child how or why to become saved. At first, it appeared that I wouldn't find what I was looking for. Disappointed, I flipped to Genesis. There it was. With the telling of Adam and Eve's sin, came the Gospel. Right at the beginning, exactly where it was needed. We need a Savior and here's why and here is where you can find Him.
I've mentioned many reasons for having "photowednesdays" on this blog. some reasons are current events love of Brooklyn and keeping my idle hands from being the devils playthings.

I never want photo Wednesdays to turn into a catalogue of cliched pics of the bridge or the arch.

Tennessee invoked the rule for the 1975 season, during the time when the maximum number of scheduled games was eleven. That season, the Vols traveled to Honolulu for their 12th scheduled game, winning 28-6. There were four non-conference games at home on the schedule that season - Maryland, North Texas State, Colorado State, and Utah - with a fifth on the road (UCLA). I don't know which of those four home NC games was the extra one added due to the Hawaii game. I hope it wasn't North Texas State - the worst Volunteer loss I personally ever witnessed.

It just so happened that the idea of dissociative disorders were just beginning to be formed by psychologists in the late 1800s. Starting in the 1880s, to be more exact. Prior to this, these types of episodes as RLS describes in Jekyll and Hyde would have been attributed to demon possession, but psychologists were just realizing that traumatic events in life could cause long-term disorders. It was into this intellectual field that Jekyll and Hyde sprang, and it changed the way psychology looked at dissociative identity disorders.
Let's examine the second half of the video. One protester calls out 'Mic check!,' and everyone knows what this means. This guy will speak for us, he has something to say.

He's teaching the police a lesson in non-violence. It's amazing to see this at work.

If there was an award for courage in the cricketing world, it should very well be named after Bob Willis. When he was 26, he had operations on both his knees, which meant he was in constant pain whenever he played. In fact, on certain days, he needed to run five miles in order to generate the strength to play. It was only through his will that Willis managed to play and succeed at the top level for nine more years. At 6 feet 6 inches, Willis was an intimidating fast bowler, one of the fastest England have ever produced. His pace, bounce, aggression and swing made him deadly on all kinds of pitches across the world.

The new characters were incredibly underdeveloped; Angelica, Blackbeard, the Minister, and the mermaid all felt forced upon the audience as if we were suppose to enjoy them, but realistically they were just annoying. Angelica is mad at Jack for taking her virginity (wasn't pirates suppose to be geared for Children?) Blackbeard hides in his cabin for most of the film (wasn't he the scariest pirates of all time?) the Minister falls in love with the mermaid (who in this film can shoot spiderwebs from their wrists like Spider-Man) just because he sees her naked (again, Disney, Pirates, Children?) and the Mermaid needs to shed one tear (there were enough tears of pain from the audience to solve that problem).
The biggest thing is with Oldest and her boyfriends daughter, who's 3. The mom just up and left for the 4th time, leaving the daughter with Oldest and Boyfriend. No contact for over a month!

Schirmbeck on Wednesday filed a formal complaint over the matter with Galveston County District Attorney Jack Roady. He also asked for an investigation into whether the city's use of public funds on pro-camera advertising on the public access television channel 16 and on the city's website violates state election law. In November, residents will have a chance to vote on whether to continue the photo ticketing program. Schirmbeck believes the slick video material was produced by Redflex, but the commercials did not disclose their true origin, in violation of state campaign laws.
Jolly Holiday's- Tree 1
The race organisers couldn't help the weather, but there was a lot throughout the day which showed that given the warning they had about the likelihood of poor weather, they could have performed a whole heap better than they did. This became abundantly clear from the start as only one entrance to the stadium was open though two were advertised in the programme - this meant all runners trying to get in and out through one gate. Pandemonium. At about this time - still with half an hour to go - organisers were trying to chivee everyone out of the stadium to start lining up at the start in the cold and wet.
The implication of preparing to move Russian troops not only is to protect its own vital regional interests but possibly to assist Iran in the event of such an attack. Sources add that a Russian military buildup in the region could result in the Russian military potentially engaging Israeli forces, U.S. forces, or both.
We've done a load of work at the White Horse previously (see Rounds 1, 2, 3, 4) but we were asked back to go over a wall that we've done previously (that was looking a little grubby due to the addition of some low-grade graffiti), freshen up the gents toilet door, take care of a tall wall beside the bar and also throw in a few little extras scattered around the place. The White Horse is one of our favourite local boozers so working there is always good fun and design-wise we've obviously run with the whole White Horse identity but given it a little id-iom twist.
The crazy thing is that I never shared my passions, not even with my best friends. I think they may have guessed how obsessed I was with Star Wars and old movies. They had no understanding of my desire to be on stage. And I never once told them the name of the boy I had a crush on. At the time, I think I thought it was self-protection. That if my dreams didn't come true, at least no one knew about them, so I didn't have to be ashamed.

Well, we never made that myrtle. The problem wasn't the hogs busting us. It was the coyote. One old mangy dog was loitering around the herd. These pigs were big enough not to be bothered by a pesky song dog, but they certainly took notice of him after he caught wind of our activities and bounded away. The coup de grace, though, were the turkeys. A couple hens were holding sentry and naturally took off when they saw us, taking the finally-frightened hogs with them. Wild pigs don't have the best sense of sight, but they're wary enough to recognize something amiss. (And how strange is it to find a coyote, hogs, and turkeys hanging around each other outside of a Disney movie?)

And by the laughter, I surmise that she could tell without me letting her in on the secret. Apparently, besides my accent deepening into obscurity, I raised my voice several decibels and reverted to my Ghanenglish grammar peppered with Dagbani, something that is significantly different from the speech my Canadian-raised family is used to. And now I'm laughing and blushing, and internally cringing because I feel proud to retain vestiges of my Ghanaian communication skills, but wondering how to balance this maintenance of my slightly shifted identity while re-learning how to connect with Canadians. Especially because I need to sound polished and professional at my upcoming interviews for medicine.

Here it is. The real purpose of the visit to Pho 68. Pho with rare beef and braised beef. It looked the part, and tasted it too. They've got the makings of a really good pho here. The stock was excellent. Deep, aromatic and intensely savoury. Wafer thin slices of beef were rare on arrival but cooked through as time progressed, the gentle poaching keeping them tender. The braised beef (brisket I think) was also sliced thin, but had a stronger, minerally flavour. The tendon running through it was soft and gelatinous speaking of long, slow cooking. The noodles, save for a little gluey clump at the top, were cooked just right.

Question 3: You have the opportunity to name the next world-changing religious figure anything you want; would sell that privilege to highest bidder? If so, would you think your soul to be eternally damned?
Hmm where do I start from? where? where? where.? Oh yeah, there!. So I'm quite certain that every believer knows what "New Creation" means (at least I hope so). When asked to define the term, words like "born-again", "salvation", "repentance", "baptism" etc are bound to be used in the definition. That's all good but who really is the "NEW CREATURE"? The creation story helped me understand this better so let's start from there. Once upon a time, God created man (and woman), gave him authority over everything on earth (Genesis 1:27-31) and placed him in the Garden of Eden where man could be close to HIM (GOD) all the time. One day, the enemy of God (and all God's children), satan, tricked man into sinning against God. Satan gave man "sin and the pleasures that come with it" and in return man gave up his authority over earth and everything in it, hence, man came under the rulership of satan. Uhmm.. yeah I guess you can call it an exchange. satan brought sin to man and man paid with his authority over the earth. A poor exchange indeed.but hey, it was no robbery. Anyway, satan, having all the authority now, become the ruler of man; and man the slave of satan (Jesus replied, "Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin" John 8:32). Man was forever doomed as a slave of the enemy and like anyone who is sentenced to life imprisonment without appeal, the only way of escape is DEATH. Scary huh? I know! Well, God who created man and loved man in spite of man's disobedience wanted to free His creation from bondage so He had to send no one else but LIFE to set man free. The Son of God, JESUS CHRIST is LIFE (Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the LIFE.John 14:6; "In him was LIFE.John 1:4). JESUS was/is the only ONE who can set man free.WHY? Think of it this way. Man's only hope of escaping the slavery of satan is death and we all know everyone dies but once. You have one chance to live and after that, there is death and judgement etc. God couldn't watch man die in his sins so there had to be another way to set man free and that way is JESUS. Jesus came on the earth as a man, suffered and died.but uh huh, that's the best part. He died not just for dying sake but He died so He could defeat DEATH. He had to defeat death so He could give man a second chance to life. For 3 days He was dead but on the 3rd day, He rose again having won POWER over death."..Whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have EVERLASTING life" John 3:16. Everlasting life is possible in Jesus because He holds both the power of LIFE (because He is LIFE) and DEATH(because He defeated death) in His hands. Any man who then believes in Him is set free from slavery through death but is given another chance to live and is given a NEW LIFE. Jesus creates the old slave who died anew and breathes LIFE again into his nostrils to make him a living soul.(Then the LORD God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being: Genesis 2:7). This is why anyone who is born-again/born in Christ is said to be a NEW CREATURE (Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new: 2 Corinthians 5:17). Just like the first man ever created, the NEW CREATURE is not placed back on in the world he just got freed from, he is placed into a world, a place, a kingdom where he can be close to God again. The NEW CREATURE no longer belongs to the world of sin and slavery (.because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you- John 15:19). The blessings and authority (Gen. 1:28-31) man God first gave to man before the fall is returned to the NEW CREATURE who becomes part of the body of Christ (.and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all- Ephe. 1:20-23). Yup! Not only does the NEW YOU receive freedom and salvation in CHRIST, but you also receive power and authority over satan and his followers. So now you know.The "NEW YOU" who is born in CHRIST is more powerful and more important than can be comprehended. YOU are God's own precious POSSESSION bought at a very high price. YOU are PRICELESS as could be. Turn to HIS WORD to fully know the "NEW YOU" He created.

Now, this might sound all pretty straightforward, but Mieville's innovation is the locale. Beszel and Ul Qoma aren't neighboring cities like East and West Berlin, or Buda and Pest. Their streets and buildings literally co-occupy the same space. This creates an environment in which citizens of one city are required to "unsee" and "unhear" the citizens of the other, even though they might be walking down the same street or sitting on the same park bench. Monitoring everyone from both cities is the (almost) all-seeing secret police, Breach, which ruthlessly "disappears" offenders that break the rules of separation.

My theme for this month is Go Outside. Weird, possibly, but relevant, particularly since in just 21 days I will be swimming 5km for Marie Curie Cancer Care. In the last month I have done precisely no training whatever, so I'm very likely to not make my target of under an hour and a half, but I will complete the 5km, come hell or high water. I plan to go to the gym every day for the next 21 days, starting tomorrow. It's a good theme, I think. I plan to spend regular time outside or at the gym, even if it's only half an hour. Money is tight again now, but going for a walk is free and it's a good way to spend time with my kids, my man or just myself. I tend to do my best thinking in the five minutes it takes me to shower - I've come up with all sorts of speech ideas and blog posts, you wouldn't believe it. I hope that a couple of hours in the gym every day will give me lots of great thinking time and lots of fabulous ideas will flow.

The place was full to the brim, with most of the patrons on a first-name basis with the owner - a charmingly flamboyant Vietnamese native who takes the utmost pride in each dish that comes out of his kitchen.
Reaching goals requires motivation. ZenHabits does a nice job of explaining motivation, as well as ways to achieve it and sustain it during times of struggle. To find out more about motivation, check out the self-motivation quiz from Mindtools. After the quiz, there is a nice explanation of factors involved in self-motivation including: self-confidence and efficacy, positive thinking, focus, and environment. The author from the article How Self-Motivated Are You noted, "Self-motivation doesn't come naturally to everyone. And even those who are highly self-motivated need some extra help every now and then. Build your self-motivation by practicing goal-setting skills, and combining those with positive thinking, the creation of powerful visions of success, and the building of high levels of self-efficacy and self-confidence."
And next time I won't be as uncomfortable.

Having such a huge burden gone has effected everything. I am back to making my meals in the morning. My dishes routine is working again. I have had the extra time to put most my cupboards etc in order again. It's like there's a light at the end of the tunnel...with projects I have been craving to do for so long. Stuff I enjoy. The last week or two I have started to feel that old me again. That girl that used to enjoy LOTS of things. Feels so good.
WEALTHY FAMILIES: The first is wealthy families where the older generation has retired or is nearing retirement. Typically, their income is secure and they're concerned primarily with wealth protection and transfer. Agents may find that these wealthy families can take underutilized or under-performing assets and convert them to a permanent life insurance policy, often with the added advantage of a LTC rider. This strategy helps secure their wealth and makes it possible to pass on their assets to heirs in a tax-advantaged way, as well as assuring their long-term security if they need care.
- The song makes you want to hear it again after its over
Billy slowly drove into Casey's driveway, and although she had been through a night of fear and terror, she felt nothing other than happiness and joy when she saw her house. It looked like heaven to Casey because she wasn't even sure if she would live to see daylight. Casey slung open the truck door and jumped out of Billy's truck in lightening speed. As she ran up to the driver's side and softly said "I know exactly what happened last night, Billy. You guys drugged me and raped me. And I will never forget it. You're going to get away with it because I am too ashamed to tell anyone what you guys did to me. You can bet your ass that God will avenge my honor. You may not go to jail, but you will suffer for what you did to me." Billy looked at her, and he was completely stunned that she remembered what had happened. This is probably due to, the fact that they gave her what they thought was a drug that would make her forget. Evidently, the effects weren't as potent as Billy had hoped.

TMT, developed over 20 years ago by social psychologists, explains how humans come to cope with death anxiety by developing self-esteem and attributing purpose to life. However, we do this by shoring up our own cultural identities, self-esteem, and frankly become more conservative in the way that we view others who might threaten our world view. So while Dark Tourism might make us feel all the better about being alive, it may make us less tolerant of others which just seems so counter-intuitive.

Atheists themselves admit this. Thus having no possible proof of their position, it requires blind faith alone to sustain it. Incredible arrogance is also within them to assume there is no God.

Anyone who has sung in a cathedral choir in Britain or Ireland will know and love Stanford's church music, which set a standard and started a vigorous tradition what extended almost to the present day. But what I am uploading is one of his piano concertos, played with great verve by the young Irish pianist Finghin Collins. It's classic Stanford - you can hear a nod to Rachmaninoff in the first movement, but the bluff, muscular energy is very much Stanford. I played the first piano quartet a while back, and you notice the same thing - you have to dig into the music from bar one (literally for the strings, who have a wonderful flourish to open the work).

The tan color deepened to brown and spread around me. To my astonishment, the area of color developed, like a photo, into a vision of a man with chocolate-brown skin. He superimposed himself over the left side of my face and upper chest and my left arm, and I perceived him as if from the inside and the outside at the same time. I could actually see him, with technicolor clarity, something that had never, ever happened to me before. He looked to be in his mid-thirties, with very round cheeks and prominent eyes, a little like Louis Armstrong. I heard the name "Bertram."

I first saw this H&M snake-embossed envelope clutch weeks ago at a location in the city, fell in love (who would've thought since I hate snakes?!), but passed because I didn't have my 20% coupon with me. Days later, when I was ready to actually buy, I couldn't find it anywhere in the stores near me. This is what I get for wanting to save $4 lol. I was about to give up when I recently revisited one of the stores and saw they had restocked. Hallelujah!

Alan was born in the Auvergnat town of Riom. His father Georges (Jord in Breton) Cochevelou was a civil servant in the French Ministry of Finance who achieved his dream of recreating a Celtic or Breton harp in the small town of Gourin, Brittany. In 1953, Alan began playing the instrument at the age of nine under the tutelage of his father and Denise Megevand, a concert harpist. Alan also learned Celtic mythology, art and history as well as the Breton language, traditional Breton dance and the Scottish bagpipe and the bombarde, a traditional Breton instrument, from the oboe family. Alan began playing concerts at eleven years and studying traditional Breton, English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh folk music, also learning the drum, Irish flute, and tin whistle. He competed in and won several Breton traditional music competitions in the Bleimor Pipe band. Alan spent his childhood in Paris, with its cosmopolitan influences from France, Algeria, Morocco and elsewhere. But he fell in love with Breton music and Celtic culture in general, and often went back in his teens to Brittany.

The ideas employed in foul play are given a false foundation but one that is seemingly real. They depend on the person to whom they present the ideas to mistake the reality. Thus the targeted person believes their somatic reactivity is evidence that the idea is real. And this is generally true. If we sense danger for instance, even though we don't have sensory information our body will move to fear because that is natural. It is the preparation of our body to face and deal with the danger. In foul play the danger card is play to cause the targeted person to mistakenly believe that the presented idea, of which they are more conscious, has led to their somatic arousal. This empowers the ideas. In reality the danger posed and the idea presented are unrelated. It is through trickery that the person targeted is brought along to believing in the ideas presented. And you will see that with certainty when you are no longer unsuspecting of the foul play having done the experiments and having seen how easily you can be manipulated while believing the medical misinformation. And that includes the psychiatric babble about misreading others if you are suspicious. What they are effectively saying is that you have to accept appearances at face value. That's self-serving garbage. When you have done the experiments and "wised up" or "level up" to use PC game parlance, then the foul game can't be played as to obtain a result. You can "walk through the valley of the shadow of death and fear no evil"! A knowledgeable person can stand against the evil mobs and win. I am living proof of that but you need to see that for yourselves. It is good for you to be sceptical of what I am presenting but please also be curious. This is not about some academic pursuit; this is a life and death matter. To be empowered and reap the benefits for yourselves you must realize the truth and not just know it.

Scientists at Rothamsted are trialling a variety of GM wheat that produces a pheromone that aphids don't like. Aphids eat wheat, and reduce crop yields. If you can stop them from going near the wheat, then the yields should be higher. As a pre-emptive strike, I'm going to point out that the gene added to the wheat occurs naturally in many species of plant. It is not, as has been said, a 'cow gene'.

Well, we never made that myrtle. The problem wasn't the hogs busting us. It was the coyote. One old mangy dog was loitering around the herd. These pigs were big enough not to be bothered by a pesky song dog, but they certainly took notice of him after he caught wind of our activities and bounded away. The coup de grace, though, were the turkeys. A couple hens were holding sentry and naturally took off when they saw us, taking the finally-frightened hogs with them. Wild pigs don't have the best sense of sight, but they're wary enough to recognize something amiss. (And how strange is it to find a coyote, hogs, and turkeys hanging around each other outside of a Disney movie?)

Almost the exact middle, actually. Young and school-trained London singer Woon's debut album, Mirrorwriting, sits between Katy B and James B, pop theatricality and singer-songwriter calm, club culture and bedroom indie, old-school soul and modern electronic R&B, extroverted and introverted. And tying it all together is the language of UK bass. His first major single, 2010's justly lauded "Night Air", announced him as one of a number of young English artists for whom garage, and everything that came after, was just another bit of pop language to use. And from the slow-motion jungle syncopations and muted bass blare of "Street" to the stuttering retro-rave breakbeats that drive "Spirits", the computer-assisted Woon makes sorta-pop from the last 20 years of UK dance the way current U.S. guitar kids draw from surf-rock and girl-groups.

I know I'm just a crass American with no business chiming in on finer points of eti-quette and pro-to-col ... but I do know about a bit about trying mothers-in-law. So, I've taken the liberty of channeling my inner Dear Abby and drafting a little missive of my own:
It was a grade ten class (or the tenth grade as they say down south, a form which always causes me to imagine the voice of James Earl Jones), mostly constituted with boys. Although teenage males can be (ahem - pun warning) boysterous, it was a pretty good class. It was a group that could easily have gotten out of hand, but somehow, we found a way to co-exist, and it actually turned out to be quite a good class.
Geraldo made a statement that African American & Latino parents should know better than to let their children walk around with hoodies on because people will fear them. That's the hood will give people cause to arrest, frisk and/or harass them. He actually stated that the hoodie was as much to blame for Trayvon's murder as is Zimmerman. Yes, you read that right! This fool not only said, but then he tweeted it! Okay, well guess what? Zimmerman is not a police officer. Trayvon did not need to keep his hands and face in plain view of Zimmerman. Zimmerman sought him out and approached him. Trayvon didn't put his hoodie on until he felt someone following him. Before that he was a teenager walking down the street in a sweatshirt on a cold rainy night. Unless the boy was picking a lock or peering through someone's window, I'm not sure how he falls under a suspicious category. So its actually NOT the hoodie's fault.it's actually the ignorant vigilante's fault this boy is dead!
Maybe Facebook should hire Thomas Friedman to do its ads. His ad for Coursera (h/t Indyanna's comment at Historiann's) column on online education pretty much explains why the 100,000-person online class and the flipped classroom, with local professors as glorified tutors, is the way to go. The comments are good, and they ask the same questions we've all been asking and come to some similar conclusions.
As for my back, it was a pinched nerve controlling my left side, one vertebra off 100ths of an inch to cause such a extreme amount of discomfort and one day no walking because I was bent over in such a way it was difficult to walk (it was a Saturday, Thank God).

You are transformed into a world where rolling hills, sprawling vineyards, beautiful houses, and quaint villages take over. From lunch with a traditional Italian family to cooking pasta, visiting shops selling ham, cured meats and cheese, tasting wines and visiting a local factory making pasta, Antonio and Gennaro keeps you entertained with their wit and humour in Bologna- their first stop. Next they move on to the South of Italy to the Amalfi coast, where Gennaro grew up. Personally this was the most favourite episode for me. Cooking by the sea side, plucking fresh lemons off the trees and biting into them, preparing a linguine dish on a boat using fresh octopus and mussels which Gennaro collected after his diving expedition and the wit and humour the two Italians share among themselves were absolutely fun to watch. Ah! the ricotta and lemon tart they made in this episode still holds fresh in my memory. Its high up there on my to-make list.

The external and internal journey are juxtaposed throughout and emotionally she explores the caution, the fear the sense of loss and longing, the feelings engendered by isolation and fellowship. Throughout the book Carroll wrestles with the difference between being a tourist and being a traveller and ultimately resolves this issue. The difference of pace is one thing but there's much more to it than that.

So that will be my end goal for this week: make one card in remodeled craft room. How hard that that be? Really? LOL LOL

Do you have a day to day writing schedule or do you fit in the words wherever you can (like so many of us!)
Earlier this year when us girls went to Mabula for a week of chilling and scrapping we came across this old yellow bus at a little farm stall, and being committed scrappers we could not pass up the opportunity for a photo (ok more than a photo).
The time has come - finally - for somebody with a sensible agenda to intervene in the insane race now taking place across the Channel between the markets and Berlin. Not just because, if they don't, scorched earth will be all that's left; but also because both sides are scared - and so the time is right.
I'm sure they'll get easier, but this year is going to be hard. I know this.

Personally, I go over Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Tumblr and scroll up and down, click on links, read, comment, like, circle, hangout, reblog, retweet, share, email, troll and all the things possible of what social media has offered us today.
Thanks for stopping by today!! Tomorrow will be my last post here at HALLMARK LADYBUGS! It's been FUN and I hope you've enjoyed it too!
"Since Anne Waldman gathered 31 poets at the very first marathon on January 2, 1974, countless forward-facing luminaries have thrown their voices into the cauldron - among them Eric Bogosian, William S. Burroughs, Spalding Gray, Jackson Mac Low, Ed Sanders, Pedro Pietri, Helen Adam, John Cage, Joe Ceravolo, John Giorno, Ted Berrigan, Yoko Ono, Amiri Baraka, Gordon Matta Clark, Jim Carroll, Bernadette Mayer, Alice Notley, Steve Cannon, Hannah Weiner, Kathy Acker, Arthur Russell, Gerard Malanga, Suzanne Vega, Allen Ginsberg, Patti Smith, and Philip Glass. The list grows every year, as does the roster small press publishers and local restaurants who donate deliciousness in the form of astounding books, journals and food. We're not so secretly in love with them all - and with the 75 selfless volunteers too who keep the Marathon running.

The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said Deputy Juan Lazu was on patrol in Tampa early Sunday when a large SUV crossed the median and continued in the wrong direction.

This is an example of churnalism at its laziest worst. Or is it something more sinister? The statement from the court suggested that "Such inventions are a kind of blood libel, and we wonder why the inventor of the story did not continue to describe how we collected the blood of the dog to make our matzah." That might be going too far. But it says a lot about BBC journalism that they imagined that stoning reincarnated dog lawyers to death was the sort of thing Orthodox Jews get up to.
One thing I would be interested in doing is being diagnosed. It's been about 5 years since I last saw a psychiatrist and i guess you could technically say that the BPD diagnosis I received back then wasn't "official". He just showed me the symptoms in a book, asked me what I thought, and I said I agreed.

When we allow ourselves to let go of wanting the other to fill us up, when we let ourselves be real, as we are, another energy comes through our body and being. It will charge our entire being with a presence, a force that is absolutely free of wanting. We feel open, grounded, free, humble and powerful - zero and everything. It is as through our body, heart and soul simultaneously flower in reverential awe of the moment. This force is an exquisite expression of the flower of life itself.

Joe Lipa brought two of my favorite beers of the entire festival. The first was Orval Trappist Ale which poured a hazy light amber color with floral, citrus and spice aromas. Nice tart flavors with a surprisingly full bodied mouthfeel. There was a slight hop bite with cider-like flavors. Very complex and interesting. The next was Lindemans Gueuze Cuvée René. This beer poured a golden color with very gentle aromas of fruit. The flavors were tart and refreshing with hints of yeast and cellar-like flavors. This was a very simple beer with quite a bit of depth.

By the time Douglas Jardine's Bodyline series came around, Bradman was only 24 and had already scored 2695 runs in 19 Tests at 112.3 with 12 centuries, including the world record score of 334. The Bodyline was his weakest series but he still managed 396 runs in 4 games at an average of 56.75 (higher than the career averages of Lara, Tendulkar, Chappell, Gavaskar and Ponting). He scored 12 double centuries in just 80 innings and registered a further seven 150+ scores. His tragically legendary average of 99.94 is one of the most widely known sport statistics worldwide. He is not just the greatest batsman in cricket history but also one of the greatest sportspersons ever, with the Time magazine rating him alongside the likes of Muhammad Ali, Babe Ruth, Juan Manuel Fangio and Pele. Bradman is much more than an icon or a hero; he is a figure that transcends the game he played and stands for something much greater than that. Bradman is the epitome of the pinnacle of human achievement in sports.
An early start for this one at the northern end of Bassenthwaite Lake. There was a heavy mist when I first arrived which slowly lifted. This is twenty minutes from my home so I'm often at the lake's shores with my camera. Very peaceful on this particular morning; did not see a soul.
Note: don't expect the dough to rise during this period - remember, it's not a yeast bread, and by definition unleavened ('chappa' means flattened in Tamil). I assumed this was more of a "rest" period for the gluten and what not in the flours to react with the water. Other chapati recipes online, however, don't include the hour rest period, so if you're in a rush I'm tempted to say you could skip it.
Not only did I rework that original block, but I have since done more applique' work (that Scrappy Dresden Plate quilt I'm working on requires applique', as do the monthly minis for Sandy's monthly QAL) and now in charge of the design for our next guild Opportunity (raffle) Quilt for 2014. Do you know what I've chosen for us to do? You guessed it if you said, "an applique' quilt"! I'll save that whole story for another day, but for now, I want to tell you about an idea that our friend, Flo shared during our coffee group.

The chipotle chicken taco comes with black bean relish, fresco, tomatilla salsa and chipotle sauce and there's plenty of flavour in the shroom taco, a mix of wild mushrooms with pickled enoki, shredded red cabbage, queso fresco cheese, avocado salsa and chipotle sauce.
But, "We remain cautious about pronouncing a turnaround until we observe a couple more quarters of improvement," said Reis. "As we have observed in the recent past, two consecutive quarters of improvement are not necessarily the beginning of a trend and are insufficient to declare that a recovery is underway."
The point here is surely not to deride empiricism. Heaven knows conservatism could stand to quit leading with its heart and start thinking more empirically about the world as it is, not the world as they wish it to be. The point, if I'm reading them correctly, is that too many leading voices on the left give themselves over to wonkiness, and presume that their moral convictions are widely shared, such that the only reason anybody could disagree with them is through ignorance (willful or not), or malice.
I finally switched on my computer (largely because I had an e-mail from a French friend that asked why there were no results) and found the HuffPo summary immediately. No surprises. Labour making gains at the government's expense - it was expected and is not unusual for local elections around half-way through a government's life. Under the Thatcher government this used to happen quite often yet the lady went on to lead her party to victory several times.
I first saw this H&M snake-embossed envelope clutch weeks ago at a location in the city, fell in love (who would've thought since I hate snakes?!), but passed because I didn't have my 20% coupon with me. Days later, when I was ready to actually buy, I couldn't find it anywhere in the stores near me. This is what I get for wanting to save $4 lol. I was about to give up when I recently revisited one of the stores and saw they had restocked. Hallelujah!

The biggest thing is with Oldest and her boyfriends daughter, who's 3. The mom just up and left for the 4th time, leaving the daughter with Oldest and Boyfriend. No contact for over a month! Oldest and Boyfriend went to a lawyer to see what they could do, and the lawyer said NOTHING. Yep, nothing. A judge in our county won't rule against a mom who has several domestic violence charges called to her home, who has pulled a gun on her current boyfriend several times, has a mental illness, and has had several attempted suicides!

The ideas employed in foul play are given a false foundation but one that is seemingly real. They depend on the person to whom they present the ideas to mistake the reality. Thus the targeted person believes their somatic reactivity is evidence that the idea is real. And this is generally true. If we sense danger for instance, even though we don't have sensory information our body will move to fear because that is natural. It is the preparation of our body to face and deal with the danger. In foul play the danger card is play to cause the targeted person to mistakenly believe that the presented idea, of which they are more conscious, has led to their somatic arousal. This empowers the ideas. In reality the danger posed and the idea presented are unrelated. It is through trickery that the person targeted is brought along to believing in the ideas presented. And you will see that with certainty when you are no longer unsuspecting of the foul play having done the experiments and having seen how easily you can be manipulated while believing the medical misinformation. And that includes the psychiatric babble about misreading others if you are suspicious. What they are effectively saying is that you have to accept appearances at face value. That's self-serving garbage. When you have done the experiments and "wised up" or "level up" to use PC game parlance, then the foul game can't be played as to obtain a result. You can "walk through the valley of the shadow of death and fear no evil"! A knowledgeable person can stand against the evil mobs and win. I am living proof of that but you need to see that for yourselves. It is good for you to be sceptical of what I am presenting but please also be curious. This is not about some academic pursuit; this is a life and death matter. To be empowered and reap the benefits for yourselves you must realize the truth and not just know it.

The aroma was filled with the recognizable smell of Smith and Cross: strong, funky and full of promise. Of course the molasses was there as well, though I am still not sure if I was smelling the actual molasses or the Smith and Cross. Also, the pineapple spear, which was an utter garnish failure, awkward protuberance that it was, added a bit of undefinable fruitiness to the nose. The first sip was very molasses-y, though the hogo of the rum carried through at the end. You would think that there would be some sweetness in this drink, but it was dry and earthy, with a vague powdery texture that made each sip seem almost chewy. After I increased the bitters, the spices became more detectable on the swallow. The flavors of the molasses were also enhanced by the increase in bitters--the drink seemed sweeter, in that pleasing molasses cookie way, and the flavors in general seemed more balanced. Overall, not bad but not great.
As for trying two new activities a month, I've decided that one a week would be more fun, and give me an excuse to try to write once a week as well. I'll try to keep that content a little more locally based but the dig in challenge can really be done wherever you are. I don't think it matters where in the world you live, supporting your local economy is important.

A girl should learn to put her gown on properly. No creature living takes more heed of externals than your orthodox man. He may not know the price, color, or material of your clothes, but he will know to a nicety whether you are well or badly gowned.
She is taking her ugly duckling status hard. She shrieks her Skeksis complaint call at everyone and everything. The serama have taken to hiding from her, and even the other pekins are giving her a wide berth. The newspaper on the coop floor feels the brunt of her temper, and she is spending a lot of time shrieking in the coop and flinging strips of mutilated broadsheet out of the pop hole door. The others wisely let her go to bed first, and only venture in to the coop when she's settled down to sleep. No one risks perching next to her. To add insult to injury, I have smothered her in mite powder as a precaution. So now she looks like a middle aged, balding goth with dandruff. It's a hard look to rock, frankly.

A woman told reporters that when midnight arrived Cinderella left the ball in great haste and the prince chased after her as if he couldn't stop himself. But when he arrived outside she was gone, almost by magic, with only a gold slipper left as a clue to her identity.
The gates leading out of the courtyard are open and hundreds upon hundreds of robots like myself are pouring through them, seeking a life free of chains. I can hear the crack of bullets and the high pitched screams of guards attempting to stop the waves of angry metal, they are crushed like insignificant bugs.
The guru, or acaryadeva, as we learn from the bona fide scriptures, delivers the message of the absolute world, the transcendental abode of the Absolute Personality, where everything nondifferentially serves the Absolute Truth. We have heard so many times: mahajano yena gata sa pantha ("Traverse the trail which your previous acarya has passed"), but we have hardly tried to understand the real purport of this sloka. If we scrutinizingly study this proposition, we understand that the mahajana is one, and the royal road to the transcendental world is also one. In the Muaka Upaniad (1.2.12) it is said:
Maybe Facebook should hire Thomas Friedman to do its ads. His ad for Coursera (h/t Indyanna's comment at Historiann's) column on online education pretty much explains why the 100,000-person online class and the flipped classroom, with local professors as glorified tutors, is the way to go. The comments are good, and they ask the same questions we've all been asking and come to some similar conclusions.
Things have definitely CHANGED since we last went bowling.
There was that time I watched my father in a televised drama where he was portraying yet another down and out character. There was a part where he was cold and shivering and sad, and I am told I came out from under the dining table that was my favourite hiding spot and offered my blankie to the television set saying "Here daddy, you can have my blankie, you don't have to be cold!" The adults thought that was the sweetest, funniest thing ever, but to my four year old mind, my father was suffering and I wanted to help. I knew he was pretending, but could I be really, really sure he wasn't actually cold?
To sum it all up, I believe that every writer/director/cinematographer should watch this prank which turned into a viral video ad campaign for TNT.
I have gone to doctors who thought it would be easy to take advantage of a broken girl. What they didn't know is that this girl may be broken, but very bad tempered as well and not scared of saying "no way" while stumbling out of the room.
Yet so are you, so why me?
You know the old phrase, "Stop and smell the roses"? I think stopping to smell the lilacs is even more important since their luscious blooms only happen for a short time each year. I have to remember to jam my nose into their blooms (checking for bees first, of course) and drink up all their sweet fragrance often before it's gone.

I can imagine them saying that it is my time to give back to my father for all he has done for me. That there are things I will be learning in this experience, marathon that it is. They would point out that it is an opportunity for me to develop and express a selfless love. And they would remind me that my father, even in his condition, matters to God. His soul is intact even as his mind is fading.

When one adds to this the fact that the arts are not only an economic multiplier, but also a social and cultural multiplier in an economy in which jobs are becoming even less and less interesting, it can make more sense to implement arts support schemes than it does in periods when the work ethic seems to be operating at its full volume.

It was so cute. SOOOOO CUTE. Take a look at this photo, which I didn't want to copy here because it's copyrighted, to get an idea of the cuteness of this mouse. It was about the size of a quarter.

Inspired by the TED talk that Graham Hill gave about becoming a weekday vegetarian, I too am going to aspire for that. I want to make sure that i am able to uphold my agreement so my aim to eat vegetarian for 4 out of the 7 days of the week. So I will have the weekends to enjoy meat, and one day of the week if i am especially feeling like i need to have a nice burger or something. This effects so many parts of the global environment that it is something that a lot of people need to consider. It will help with energy use, preserving land, animal rights, cut back on unhealthy foods and water pollution.

It's impossible to say for certain if greater awareness of SUDEP by family members, and by the loved ones themselves, could have prevented Jordan and Traci's deaths. That isn't the point of this article and of the education work that SUDEP Aware is doing. The point is that people with epilepsy need to understand the reality of SUDEP so that they can make their daily decisions with the full knowledge of the risk factors involved.

But this movie is not made for people like me. It is made for a different demographic, which is fine. I knew it going in, but I had heard enough to suggest it would have, like, cross-subcultural appeal. It did not.

In other Spring-related news the clocks are going forward on Saturday, so I will be losing an hour's worth of sleep (boo!). This means darker mornings for a bit, but lighter evenings. One of my favourite things about living in the Northern Hemisphere is that, in summer, it stays light until 10:00pm at night. I love how you can leave work at 17:30 and still feel like you have a substantial evening ahead of you. I will also no longer have to run in the dark, hunkering close to the H37 bus route and sprinting passed dark alleyways and spooky driveways ... it's the small things in life.

So we're back, it has been a life-changing experience, there have been a few tears but many, many, laughs. It is something that I have loved doing and it's bought Nabeela and I closer together. I would not change this experience for anything - and I'd do it all again if I had the chance and would recommend it to anyone (finances and life-situation permitting).
Even more importantly I think I'm having a rebirth of my spirit. For the longest time I've basically just existed. I've done the bare minimum around the house. It's been a struggle to get that done too. But the last few weeks I've been WANTING to spread my wings and take the time to make the homemade breads and the homemade snacks. I've been wanting to do that stuff. It's almost like I'm being reborn. I don't know what has brought this about. I'm afraid to blink...afraid that it will go away if I do. I still have all the stress and depression in my life....but I'm really trying to not let it affect ME. And maybe that's the whole difference.

I followed my parent's home, even though they weren't aware of my presense. My mom wept all the way while my dad remained silent. He begged my mom to calm down but it all fell on deaf ears. We got home to find the house filled with friends and relatives, my Dad carried my body and laid it on the mat in the living room. Prayers for forgiveness were said, and my parents were advised to stop crying as it wouldn't bring me back. I watched my Mom cry and weep all night as she asked God why He Had to take my life.
it just stands out as a "better than what i feel i am capable of" type of photo. but i have to say... i got lucky. i mean, look at my subject! she is like a goddess. the expression on her face was completely her doing. i in no way directed her to look so expressive and perfectly frozen in time. so peaceful. so beautiful. so, i know i am just lucky. still... i pushed the shutter button at the precise moment to capture this image, so i have to give myself at least a little credit. and thus, i can not help but make this my favorite photo.

Covey amplifies his message by means of wide-ranging examples of "third alternative thinkers". There's the local police force that transformed a crime-plagued community by casting off its entrenched "them against us" mentality. Another example tells the tale of a father who, during the course of one extraordinary evening, rescued his daughter from years of clinical depression. Then there's the judge who brought a swift and peaceful end to a massive environmental lawsuit without setting foot in a courtroom.

As someone with Type 1 diabetes (the "real" diabetes, as I like to put it -- the kind you can't help getting), I sometimes wonder when I'll end up retiring, or how long I can escape death. So I wonder how much I should be saving for retirement. Will I get the typical 25-30 year long retirement? Or would I have to retire at 40 to pull that one off? If I work until I'm 65, I could have lots put away, only to die within 2 years if I'm lucky, on the other hand.

Dad went for a walk around when we got there and mum and i got the boys into their swimmers. Then Jordy was straight in the river and wanting to go floating off downstream. Mum had Darcy and i was still getting ready to get in and Jordy is off! Little bugger. I was a bit worried about him going over the edge of the waterfall but i met him down the end and he kicked over to me. Not that it was a big waterfall! He would not have been hurt if he went over but he might have scared himself.

Charming landscaping. Flanked by a community mosque on one side and the Karachi residence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi on the other, Hilal Park stretches over a hillock. The landscape design, which makes exceptional use of the topography, is the highlight of the Park. A brick path, edged with immaculately pruned topiaries weaves through well-maintained, exotically shaped flower beds, up a hill, and over culverts and wooden bridges that span over the narrow ravines in the rock formations.
It was a simple chance event on a London underground station that got me thinking about luck, chance and randomness and led many years later to my new novel, Wasted. It wasn't an earth-shattering event but it got me thinking. Obsessively. So, I began a novel for adults - I'd two unpublished ones languishing already - about chance, quantum mechanics, and unpredictability, involving repeated multiple possibilities. The idea was that if there is a god - which I know there isn't - he will either play dice or at least have a lot of fun observing. But halfway through, a completely different idea hit me, this time for teenagers. I abandoned god and quantum
So I pondered and scratched out various possibilities, and casually read through various texts by and about Che or Abe, wondering what the most suggestive, poetic and concise way of connecting these two men across time and history could be, until one day I hit on something that I just knew was right. It was a quote, by Che, in reference to his trip to New York City in 1964 to address the United Nations' General Assembly. It seems that while he was in New York there were two attempts on his life, one by a man wielding a gun and one by a woman with a knife. When asked about these attacks by a journalist, he is said to have responded with a smile and a bemused wisecrack: "It is better to be killed by a woman with a knife than a man with a gun" said Che.

As the nightly program wound through several non-college football segments, Dunlaw reflected on the surreal nature of his situation: "I still can't believe Herbie's sleeping with my Tracy. It's so unreal. I feel like I should be texting Knox right now. Y'know, something like, 'Oh my god. You won't believe this! This is amazing!'"

Thus, no doubt soon you will probly hear soon some business leaders or pretend potential self-appointed communist leaders lamenting the lack of organization of the #Occupy movements, describing them as "in choate" (which is a kind of wide penis with no head), or "udderless," or "lacking discernible goals" (like Sporting Gijon). What they are really mean is that there is a ferment of new ideas that therefore could be dangerous and must be curtailed, or at least curtopped. After all, nobody has any idea where a march that goes nowhere might end up. If these peoples weren't too feckless to emigrate we could at least lure them onto a ferry with the promise of jobs in Australia and transport them there. We would never hear of them ever again! But while they are there, in the midst of ordinary, heads-down, knees-back God-fearing punters, fermenting theories without limitations and trying out new processes, such as democracy-never a positive development-they constitute a threat to our docile, passive, obedient way of life. They must be stomped on by square-headed baton-wielding riot police, preferably from up the country, before any new ideas seep out into the public body at large, like a ball of ideological pus.

antique reproductions to create our bathroom vanity...a painted and antiqued pine cupboard. I really want to keep things plain and simple and his vanity fits right in with that vision. I got my hubby to install the bowl sink and the hand pump style faucet. The lighting was purchased from EBay and was handcrafted in Pennsylvania. Last but not least I hung an antique mirror and picture...& a fresh spring bouquet sits on the windowsill.
I was reading something about trust the other day and I apologize for not remembering where I read it or who to give credit to but the thought has been percolating in my mind so much so I had to write about it in my own words.

"The Wallflower" rose to No. 2 on the rhythm-and-blues charts in 1954. As was often the case in those days with records by black performers, a toned-down version was soon recorded by a white singer and found a wider audience: Georgia Gibbs's version, with the title and lyric changed to "Dance With Me, Henry," was a No. 1 pop hit in 1955. (Its success was not entirely bad news for Ms. James. She shared the songwriting royalties with Mr. Ballard and the bandleader and talent scout Johnny Otis, who had arranged for her recording session. (Mr. Otis died on Tuesday.)

The biggest thing is with Oldest and her boyfriends daughter, who's 3. The mom just up and left for the 4th time, leaving the daughter with Oldest and Boyfriend. No contact for over a month! Oldest and Boyfriend went to a lawyer to see what they could do, and the lawyer said NOTHING. Yep, nothing. A judge in our county won't rule against a mom who has several domestic violence charges called to her home, who has pulled a gun on her current boyfriend several times, has a mental illness, and has had several attempted suicides!
If I didn't know any better i'd be an alcoholic by now, good thing i'm smarter than that.

I finally switched on my computer (largely because I had an e-mail from a French friend that asked why there were no results) and found the HuffPo summary immediately. No surprises. Labour making gains at the government's expense - it was expected and is not unusual for local elections around half-way through a government's life. Under the Thatcher government this used to happen quite often yet the lady went on to lead her party to victory several times.

He's not a star pupil, but he's pretty good. He's not the most diligent of swots, and needs to be told to make his bed or tidy his room. But amazingly, although he occasionally issues me with warnings not to embarrass him (I know, what a spoilsport!), he still seems to like spending some of his time with us.

First I placed a straight pin through the center of a red felt Pretty Posy, then I placed it through each section of the wheel as I bent it in. Then I used the pin to attach the pinwheel to the eraser of the pencil. I bent the pin down and taped it securely to the pencil so no fingers would get pricked.

Anyway, I haven't been able to visit the lovely blogs on blogosphere and telling the oh-so-many talented bloggers out there how much I love their recipes and posts. I am sorry. I truly am. I also have been very lazy with replying to the lovely people who have been leaving comments on my blog. I know its the rudest thing possible, but please know each and every comment you leave makes my day.

Color mixing went very fast for this too. I'm getting more confident with it. My blues are greyed with orange, and my reds with green. I'm finding that my blues go toward orange too much, and I think I'm going to start using black and white to grey my colors a bit more along with compliments. It really depends on the color though. Because every color has a cast to it, and isn't a perfect blue or orange, when you mix them to get grey you can get unpredictable results, and I like that, but I want to get more control over it in a more predictable way, so straight up grey should help.
"Have you seen Steven yet?" A woman asked us as she walked into our building. We gave her a confused look, pretending to have no idea what she was talking about. Acting at its finest. "I guess Steven Seagal is shooting a show here," she explained. We had her fooled. Can anyone say Oscar?!

Let me tell you, I previously loved Gerard Butler's Phantom but Ramin Karimloo's Phantom made me want to hop through my television set, kick Christine out of the picture and run away with him on the streets of Paris. He was AMAZING with a gorgeous voice and so much raw, sexy emotion. Despite kicking her to the side for the Phantom the gorgeous Sierra Boggess was an awesome Christine with an amazingly hypnotic voice. The height of the play where they sang the theme song was filled with such romance and emotion. I also fell in love with the Music of the Night from Ramin's emotionally raw and sexy voice. I had to grab the soundtrack after to relive the experience over and over again. I simply fell in love with the production!

As a parent of two children myself, as a wife, and as a daughter of a cancer survivor, I could not simply just leave my "facebook words of support" and be done with it. Mark and his family are in for a long, tough road ahead and I think we all should chip in and help. I am appealing to the Atheist community, especially, since we are always accused of being "sinful" and "immoral" without "god" in our lives, but I am also appealing to all the human beings out there who know that we are one human family and that by helping eachother, even if that other person is a stranger, we are, in essence, making this world a better place for ourselves and for our children especially.

The French have been particularly explicit in their imperial intentions regarding the Middle East and Africa:
I just find the anti-German critique of certain trends and tendancies in the anti-capitalist/anti-imperialist/anti-globalisation movement(s) interesting and useful.

While I was away, my middle son Tim has completed his college courses at UNCW and has moved home in between starting his internship in Washington DC mid-January. He graduates in May with his degree in Recreation Therapy. He had a nice surprise waiting for me when I pulled into the driveway at 11PM two days before Christmas. The lighted deer and Christmas tree were in the front yard set up and glowing, attached to the Christmas lights lining the front porch my oldest son, Kerry Lee, had helped me put up during the warm spell right after Thanksgiving. Then when I came into the house I saw that Tim had set up and decorated the Christmas tree, hung the Christmas stockings for everyone including the dogs and cats, and had decorated the rest of the house as well! What a blessing!
In fact, a salad this good far outshines the name "taco" salad. After all, there's no lunch lady ice cream scoop of ground beef. No deep friend shell. No crumbled Fritos or cheddar cheese. Oh no. While those ingredients usually make other taco salads palatable, they would do nothing but disgrace the mere existence of this salad.
This year tested that faith. There is no way around it: This was a lousy year in sports. Scandal. Disgrace. Crime. The horror in and around sports rose to previously unimagined depths -- the empire struck back, the dark side reigned. Penn State dominated the news, but there were charges elsewhere, in too many places, in Miami and Ohio State and Syracuse and, well, who could keep up? Players went on strike. Owners locked out. Fan favorites left town. Legends went on trial. Concussions. Perjury. PEDs.

Having such a huge burden gone has effected everything. I am back to making my meals in the morning. My dishes routine is working again. I have had the extra time to put most my cupboards etc in order again. It's like there's a light at the end of the tunnel...with projects I have been craving to do for so long. Stuff I enjoy. The last week or two I have started to feel that old me again. That girl that used to enjoy LOTS of things. Feels so good.
I guess I'll start with the name in the address bar. For a while now (at least ten years) I've been working on a fantasy series that has recently become more serious to me. One of the main plot devices is a dream world. So, when I went to use the restroom at a truckstop one day and saw this written on the inside of one of the stalls in permanent marker, I knew I had to incorporate it into my story. Now I have a character who manufactures dreams and I am one step closer to getting this story off the ground.
When I was in Phnom Penh recently, I discovered in the guidebook that there was a cafe called the "Lazy Gecko Cafe". I looked it up on the map and saw that it was quite far from where I was staying and also from most of the areas I would be visiting. However, the pull to seek out this lazy gecko was strong and on my final day, I decided to hunt it down and sink a coffee or two.

TMT, developed over 20 years ago by social psychologists, explains how humans come to cope with death anxiety by developing self-esteem and attributing purpose to life. However, we do this by shoring up our own cultural identities, self-esteem, and frankly become more conservative in the way that we view others who might threaten our world view. So while Dark Tourism might make us feel all the better about being alive, it may make us less tolerant of others which just seems so counter-intuitive.
The most creative assault on Spencer must be Richard L. Schoenwald's psychological autopsy in the 1968 summer issue of the esteemed journal Victorian Studies, in which the historian reveals that Spencer's twisted and deformed worldview stemmed from his fascination with feces.

Heat the oil in one of those wide, deep frying pans that come with a lid. Add the onions and fry until the onions have browned and become crisp. Add the paste and powder, stirring well for a few seconds. Now add the meat and half of the salt, stir, cover and turn the heat right down. Gently fry for around 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add a pint of water (that's a British pint - 20 fluid ounces) and the potatoes, turn up the heat and when the curry comes to a boil, turn the heat back down, cover and simmer very gently until the meat is tender, around 60 to 90 minutes if using lamb, longer if using mutton. Taste and add more salt if needed.

Let's examine the second half of the video. One protester calls out 'Mic check!,' and everyone knows what this means. This guy will speak for us, he has something to say. And if they disagree, they can simply stop passing this person's words along. But in this case he speaks words of de-escalation. We will let you police leave. He's teaching the police a lesson in non-violence. It's amazing to see this at work.

Rumors were also spreading that he was suffering from an illness for which he was refusing treatment. On 3 August 1997, Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, already a prominent AIDS activist and former Minister of Health, stunned the nation by announcing his younger brother's death a day earlier from Kaposi's sarcoma which was brought on by AIDS.

We got home to find the house filled with friends and relatives, my Dad carried my body and laid it on the mat in the living room. Prayers for forgiveness were said, and my parents were advised to stop crying as it wouldn't bring me back. I watched my Mom cry and weep all night as she asked God why He Had to take my life.

Inspired by the TED talk that Graham Hill gave about becoming a weekday vegetarian, I too am going to aspire for that. I want to make sure that i am able to uphold my agreement so my aim to eat vegetarian for 4 out of the 7 days of the week.

This effects so many parts of the global environment that it is something that a lot of people need to consider. It will help with energy use, preserving land, animal rights, cut back on unhealthy foods and water pollution.

The last time I went to Las Vegas was seven years ago when I only visited for a choral directors conference with four other students who had little to no interest in eating anywhere that cost more than $5 or attending any shows and I didn't really think it would be a good idea for me to traipse around the Strip, alone. Sometimes I make really good decisions.

Liverworts, like mosses contain no vascular systems to transport water and nutrients throughout the plant. This means they are most likely to be found in damp shady locations.

We stood outside their house and hugged and prayed over them. I held each of them tight until they cried. They needed a mother's love and protection and the feel of safet, if only for a moment. I kissed them all over their faces and told them I loved them and we would see them again, and help them in the meantime. Isabelle and Johnny begged to give them all the food we had in the van, so we asked them to walk back with us. We walked down that path to the van, praying the whole way. I didn't know until later that night after looking at the pictures that we were all holding hands. Isabelle and Johnny love these girls too, and their hearts were broken and changed that day too.

By the time Douglas Jardine's Bodyline series came around, Bradman was only 24 and had already scored 2695 runs in 19 Tests at 112.3 with 12 centuries, including the world record score of 334. The Bodyline was his weakest series but he still managed 396 runs in 4 games at an average of 56.75 (higher than the career averages of Lara, Tendulkar, Chappell, Gavaskar and Ponting). He scored 12 double centuries in just 80 innings and registered a further seven 150+ scores. His tragically legendary average of 99.94 is one of the most widely known sport statistics worldwide. He is not just the greatest batsman in cricket history but also one of the greatest sportspersons ever, with the Time magazine rating him alongside the likes of Muhammad Ali, Babe Ruth, Juan Manuel Fangio and Pele. Bradman is much more than an icon or a hero; he is a figure that transcends the game he played and stands for something much greater than that. Bradman is the epitome of the pinnacle of human achievement in sports.

For this also there is no technological or large-scale solution. Perhaps, as they believe, the most conscientiously up-to-date people can easily do without local workshops and stores, local journalism, a local newspaper, a local post office, all of which supposedly have been replaced by technologies. But what technology can replace personal privacy or the coherence of a family or a community? What technology can undo the collateral damages of an inhuman rate of technological change?

Even more importantly I think I'm having a rebirth of my spirit. For the longest time I've basically just existed. I've done the bare minimum around the house. It's been a struggle to get that done too. But the last few weeks I've been WANTING to spread my wings and take the time to make the homemade breads and the homemade snacks. I've been wanting to do that stuff. It's almost like I'm being reborn. I don't know what has brought this about. I'm afraid to blink...afraid that it will go away if I do. I still have all the stress and depression in my life....but I'm really trying to not let it affect ME. And maybe that's the whole difference.

I've mentioned many reasons for having "photowednesdays" on this blog. some reasons are current events love of Brooklyn and keeping my idle hands from being the devils playthings. I've probably also mentioned it's not always easy to find a new pic of something Brooklyn-centric or born that's interesting. I never want photo Wednesdays to turn into a catalogue of cliched pics of the bridge or the arch.
Reaching goals requires motivation. ZenHabits does a nice job of explaining motivation, as well as ways to achieve it and sustain it during times of struggle. To find out more about motivation, check out the self-motivation quiz from Mindtools. After the quiz, there is a nice explanation of factors involved in self-motivation including: self-confidence and efficacy, positive thinking, focus, and environment. The author from the article How Self-Motivated Are You noted, "Self-motivation doesn't come naturally to everyone. And even those who are highly self-motivated need some extra help every now and then. Build your self-motivation by practicing goal-setting skills, and combining those with positive thinking, the creation of powerful visions of success, and the building of high levels of self-efficacy and self-confidence."

Written for ages 6 and older this is one of many delightful books in the Katie Woo series. I no longer have children or grandchildren this age but the title reminded me of my 8-year-old granddaughter (kind of a Madame Fullcharge) and I thought she and I would have fun reading it together. She wasn't interested. Said it was too young for her. That might be because she just finishing up her 4th grade brothers book, Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief. Anyway I thought the book was great and I still think she would have enjoyed it. I'll bet if I could have figured out how to get it onto Kindle she may have read it.
By the time Douglas Jardine's Bodyline series came around, Bradman was only 24 and had already scored 2695 runs in 19 Tests at 112.3 with 12 centuries, including the world record score of 334. The Bodyline was his weakest series but he still managed 396 runs in 4 games at an average of 56.75 (higher than the career averages of Lara, Tendulkar, Chappell, Gavaskar and Ponting). He scored 12 double centuries in just 80 innings and registered a further seven 150+ scores. His tragically legendary average of 99.94 is one of the most widely known sport statistics worldwide. He is not just the greatest batsman in cricket history but also one of the greatest sportspersons ever, with the Time magazine rating him alongside the likes of Muhammad Ali, Babe Ruth, Juan Manuel Fangio and Pele. Bradman is much more than an icon or a hero; he is a figure that transcends the game he played and stands for something much greater than that. Bradman is the epitome of the pinnacle of human achievement in sports.

When the captain of your ship tells you to do something in a somewhat frenzied or stern voice, it's almost always for your own good and everyone else's, so you should just shut your mouth and do it. And not get defensive about it.

But ending her relationship with the bikini company did not make Farrow any less dangerous. Her near-nakedness remained on display in places like Penthouse Magazine, FHM Magazine, and numerous other places who trade on the twisted ways of immodest women and play with the safety of the world on a regular basis. And as the years went by, Farrow started adding more tattoos to her body, making her not only an immodest women, but an immodest women who violated divine commandments by marking her body! There can be little question that she can be held responsible for the 2008 Sichuan earthquake that killed over 68,000 people in China.

Now that a few days have passed, I look back on that Chrysalis weekend with such joy. I don't think about the logistics of it all, I think about how present God was throughout it. With God's help, that weekend was flawless. And as I sat on Sunday listening to these girls talk about how positively affected they were by this weekend.. I knew at that very instant that every bit of sweat and tears was worth it.

3. (C) After thanking PM Meles for the meeting and noting the positive U.S.-Ethiopian relationship, Sen. Feingold asked the PM about Ethiopian plans for dealing with Somalia. Meles replied that the situation in Somalia had deteriorated significantly in the last six months. Like the Taliban in Afghanistan, the CIC had filled a political vacuum in Somalia, providing security and stability in areas that they controlled. Meles said the CIC was also riding a wave of resurgent Jihadism in the region which had been encouraged by developments in Iraq and Afghanistan. He noted that the CIC had been implementing the same brand of radical Islam espoused by other extremists, as was evidenced by their censoring of television programming and cinemas, as well as their ban on khat. Meles acknowledged that Somalis had traditionally resisted such extreme interpretations of Islam, but also remarked that Somalis "liked to back a winning horse" and Jihadists had accumulated a string of victories that was winning converts to their cause. This gathering military momentum had allowed a relatively small group of extremists to dominate the large and diverse organizations who formed the CIC. Meles said CIC leaders Sheik Aweys, Aidan Ayro and Hassan al-Turki had direct connections to Al Qaeda that were known to intelligence services, including in the U.S. He agreed with Sen. Feingold's suggestion that the CIC could be considered a "franchise of Al Qaeda."
Having just been exposed to tombs, mummies and the world of Hatshepsut full-throttle in a middle school text book, it seemed more fitting than ever to face the crowds and potential chaos with three kids ages 6 - 11, all in the name of seeing the real thing.

We love pork belly, but here it is more traditionally used as "pancetta", boiled in stocks and soups to add flavour or cut into tiny chunks and done on the plancha (griddle) or deep fried as a little tapas. Often it will have the skin removed.

This story focuses on John, a man that works for the government. One day he finds himself tied to a chair in an interrogation room. He doesn't know why he's there or what they want, but he does know one thing; he's not talking. As his interrogators try to coax information out of him he fades in and out of consciousness and reminisces on his life. Will he find a way to escape? Does he even want to?
But it's not. Most school chicken nuggets have at least a zillion ingredients. Okay, I exaggerate. Maybe they have thirty-five. Modified corn starch, soy, beef extract and maltodextrin - among other things - are not something I'd want any human to have in moderation. The same goes for cupcakes. I'm not against cake, and I'm not against most traditions. Just the last two weekends I let my son sing happy birthday and consume cake. But it was my choice. I was there to be his "judgment," and he ate confections. But I also know he's not likely to eat cake for another whole year. The birthdays for the February 2010 babies from my mommy groups are all done, and so is the cake. I don't have to worry about every neighborhood parent running down to the local grocery and bringing a sugar, corn syrup and white flour treat right to his preschool desk.
I climbed back into bed, snuggled under the warm covers and tried to get back to sleep, but I am too light a sleeper to turn off high-pitched sounds. Without his hearing aids in, David was oblivious to the chirps. I was a bit jealous that he could continue to sleep, while I hovered between a feeling of exhaustion, which cried out for just one more hours' sleep, and irritation at that infernal metronomic chirping.
And by the laughter, I surmise that she could tell without me letting her in on the secret. Apparently, besides my accent deepening into obscurity, I raised my voice several decibels and reverted to my Ghanenglish grammar peppered with Dagbani, something that is significantly different from the speech my Canadian-raised family is used to. And now I'm laughing and blushing, and internally cringing because I feel proud to retain vestiges of my Ghanaian communication skills, but wondering how to balance this maintenance of my slightly shifted identity while re-learning how to connect with Canadians. Especially because I need to sound polished and professional at my upcoming interviews for medicine.
It is relatively obvious that certain international business pursuits are more likely to influence environmental conditions. These types of businesses need to be especially concerned about the fashion in which they conduct business. They must assure citizens that the environment will not be tarnished for decades to come. I have no qualms about them facilitating business in an international setting, but they need to make sure that the environment doesn't become degraded as a result of their organizational operations.
My mom believes in us, in me, in our abilities to do anything we put our minds to! Never doubting, that we can and will do it. There are so many more things about my mom that I love, but this, this is what I love most about her, she believes in us!

Step 2 - Drop and Bake: Drop batter by tablespoon onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in a well pre-heated 350º F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Do not over-bake. Cookies should be a bit gooey in the center. While warm, they will be very soft on the outside, as well. Allow them to cool on the pan a few minutes and then transfer carefully to a rack to finish cooling. (They will always be somewhat soft because these are gooey fudge brownie cookies, not hard or crunchy cookies.)
Hewlett-Packard (HP) had the biggest stand with separate areas for PCs and printers.
Well, we never made that myrtle. The problem wasn't the hogs busting us. It was the coyote. One old mangy dog was loitering around the herd. These pigs were big enough not to be bothered by a pesky song dog, but they certainly took notice of him after he caught wind of our activities and bounded away. The coup de grace, though, were the turkeys. A couple hens were holding sentry and naturally took off when they saw us, taking the finally-frightened hogs with them. Wild pigs don't have the best sense of sight, but they're wary enough to recognize something amiss. (And how strange is it to find a coyote, hogs, and turkeys hanging around each other outside of a Disney movie?)
Given NuLabour's visceral hatred and contempt for the white working class, who's interests so often conflicts with those now much preferred groups, many observers would have assumed that Denham was either making a bad joke and had forgotten the punchline, or was suffering from some catastrophic mental breakdown, had they, that is, not realised that an election is imminent.
The ideas employed in foul play are given a false foundation but one that is seemingly real. They depend on the person to whom they present the ideas to mistake the reality. Thus the targeted person believes their somatic reactivity is evidence that the idea is real. And this is generally true. If we sense danger for instance, even though we don't have sensory information our body will move to fear because that is natural. It is the preparation of our body to face and deal with the danger. In foul play the danger card is play to cause the targeted person to mistakenly believe that the presented idea, of which they are more conscious, has led to their somatic arousal. This empowers the ideas. In reality the danger posed and the idea presented are unrelated. It is through trickery that the person targeted is brought along to believing in the ideas presented. And you will see that with certainty when you are no longer unsuspecting of the foul play having done the experiments and having seen how easily you can be manipulated while believing the medical misinformation. And that includes the psychiatric babble about misreading others if you are suspicious. What they are effectively saying is that you have to accept appearances at face value. That's self-serving garbage. When you have done the experiments and "wised up" or "level up" to use PC game parlance, then the foul game can't be played as to obtain a result. You can "walk through the valley of the shadow of death and fear no evil"! A knowledgeable person can stand against the evil mobs and win. I am living proof of that but you need to see that for yourselves. It is good for you to be sceptical of what I am presenting but please also be curious. This is not about some academic pursuit; this is a life and death matter. To be empowered and reap the benefits for yourselves you must realize the truth and not just know it.
But going down through the water to touch the wild man at the bottom of the pond is quite a different matter. The being who stands up is frightening, and he seems even more so now, when corporations do so much work to produce the sanitized, hairless shallow man (2) That's poor Viggo in THE ROAD, a sanitized man re-bearded, trying to be wild in a wild land, having to re-learn the role of the deep, dark masculine and getting it incorrect. No reflection on Viggo, of course, who showed he can bring that shit hardcore in the RINGS films and HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. It's more I think the head-on craftsmanshippy approach to the McCarthy novel -- it gets it too right, maybe, to work. Teardrop on the other hand is the untamed wild man, the kind of guy that creeps you out at first but then somewhere along the way, not sure when, you start to admire him. Isn't that so much better, children, than the other way around? (Beards of Bleakness: WINTER'S BONE VS. THE ROAD)
Yeah. This is most definitely going to be a challenge. I'm thinking about posting this photo on fb and suggesting it's food. It's somewhat believable - I do hail from the deep South. So wrong. So, so wrong. I meant, me.
I finally switched on my computer (largely because I had an e-mail from a French friend that asked why there were no results) and found the HuffPo summary immediately. No surprises. Labour making gains at the government's expense - it was expected and is not unusual for local elections around half-way through a government's life. Under the Thatcher government this used to happen quite often yet the lady went on to lead her party to victory several times.

It was so cute. SOOOOO CUTE. Take a look at this photo, which I didn't want to copy here because it's copyrighted, to get an idea of the cuteness of this mouse. It was about the size of a quarter.

Today the kids cut or tore colorful tissue paper and glued them to their heart-shaped boxes ($0.99 each at my local craft store). I took them home today and Mod Podged them to seal and make them shiny...Tomorrow, the kids will pick out letters to spell M-O-M (or M-A-M-I or G-R-A-N-N-Y, depending on their own special person's name) from my collection of small foam letter stickers to decorate the top. They will also decorate a bag to 'wrap' it in. And voila, Happy Mother's Day! I think they'll be super cute when they're done.

I first saw this H&M snake-embossed envelope clutch weeks ago at a location in the city, fell in love (who would've thought since I hate snakes?!), but passed because I didn't have my 20% coupon with me. Days later, when I was ready to actually buy, I couldn't find it anywhere in the stores near me. This is what I get for wanting to save $4 lol. I was about to give up when I recently revisited one of the stores and saw they had restocked. Hallelujah!

With Britain looking increasingly likely to secure possession of Palestine, it paved the way for the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a letter addressed to Victor's uncle, Lionel Walter Rothschild, which promised that His Majesty's government would do their utmost to establish 'a national home for the Jewish people' in Palestine. It was a 'declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations', and ultimately led to the creation of Israel. Today Balfour Day is celebrated there on November 2nd.

But The Phantom, it seems, has been histroically overshadowed by the truly staggering popular reception that greeted the debut of Superman, and his equally colourful cohorts (such as Batman, Captain America, et al), from the 1940s onwards. Perhaps he simply wasn't "super" enough to stand out amongst the growing throngs of super-powered crime-fighters that crowded American comic-books for the duration of World War II. Even as costumed superheroes reasserted their status (after a decade-long hiatus) as the dominant American comic-book genre throughout the 1960s, The Phantom remained a secondary character, despite earning his first self-titled American comic-book series in 1962.

I can tell you that I don't hate you, nor does Joan. All that's wanted by either of us is to have you out of her life. Hate has way of aging a person and eating away at them. It will eventually turn back on the person doing the hating, and affect them as much, or more, that it affects the object of that hate. Are you capable of letting go, or are hateful behavior and bullying the only languages you understand?

Jim Stater's Land of Nod
The Kingdom of God starts small, a grain of wheat, a mustard seed, a leaven in the loaf. And it spreads, oh, yes, it grows. But it starts small, even hidden in the secret places, a knitting together of wonder, perhaps. A candle on a lamp stand, a woman searching for a coin, a man in a field with a treasure worth selling everything to possess.
It isn't a hiding place. It is a finding place.

I had never seen so many hippies in one place outside Central Park. We were all over the grounds and buildings, setting up tents and campsites outdoors and inside, utilizing the communal kitchen, and playing together everywhere. Perhaps what amazed me most during that week was how careful we were to keep the place clean, how nothing was trashed or damaged, how all of us were committed to leaving the grounds as we'd found them or even better.

Established in 1892, CILEx was known as the Institute of Legal Executives (ILEX) in 1963 before changing its name in January 2012 when it received a royal charter. According to CILEx, 81.5 per cent of its members have parents who studied at university. Only 2 per cent of members have a lawyer for a parent. Clearly, CILEx operates in different circles from the magic-circle law firms, which have attracted criticism in the past for using the old boys' network of recruitment.

Such determination in her work life goes hand in hand with sacrifices in her social life. She often finds herself declining invites to parties or social gatherings in favour of a few more hours sewing or attending a networking event. When this happens, Judith simply reminds herself "Well they are only drinking wine, I'm not really missing out on that much". This sort of perspective has helped her throughout her career.
At first, Rebecca Smith was relieved when she got a phone call from an FBI agent. It was October, just a few months after Smith had spent $30,000 on a real estate investment. The woman who sold her the deal, Karen Hanover, hadn't come through on any of her promises, and Smith was worried.
Now that I can feel that sense of "enough" in my body, and I can trust it enough to take action around it, I don't struggle nearly as much with the wants, desires, and wishes that used to plague me. I know what is enough. For most of my life, for most things in my life, I have enough. I am enough. There is enough.

The fact that it's almost Cinco de Mayo got me thinking about, well, of all things, Cinco de Mayo. In high school I lived about two hours north of the Mexican border in West Covina, California. Being a suburb of L.A., there were a number of easy access attractions available to young people including Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm (amazing pies and fried chicken), the famed Southern California beaches where I spent most of my summers, the San Diego Zoo and Tijuana, or T.J. as we referred to it.

Whenever our right becomes the guiding factor of our lives, it dulls our spiritual insight. The greatest enemy of the life of faith in God is not sin, but good choices which are not quite good enough. The good is always the enemy of the best. In this passage, it would seem that the wisest thing in the world for Abram to do would be to choose. It was his right, and the people around him would consider him to be a fool for not choosing.

The yellow shoes I made were turned, literally. Made inside out, then flipped. The outer sole is stitched directly to the uppers. This style is around and fashionable for all of our time period. It is the least durable, since it cannot be re-soled and has to have a thinner sole to be able to be turned. However, this makes it the daintiest of shoe styles.

I really wanted to give the quilter the ability to use their stash but also allow them to go shopping. Who wouldn't want to have some of the newest cutest fabrics in their scrap quilt? It was VERY HARD for me to STOP buying fabric. I kept telling myself, "Ooooh! Wouldn't this be cute? I have to have a bit of this!" I actually used over 150+ fabrics in this quilt. I hope you have fun playing with your stash and adding the newest cutest fabrics to your quilt.

I have recently become aware of a theory that suggests as we move closer towards 21st December 2012, Earth's timelines converge and we essentially get down to only two timelines. Timeline 1 which is positive and results in the New World/Golden Age and timeline 2 which results in the New World Order controlling this planet. We are apparently on timeline 1. Can the Nine shed any light on this theory?

Given NuLabour's visceral hatred and contempt for the white working class, who's interests so often conflicts with those now much preferred groups, many observers would have assumed that Denham was either making a bad joke and had forgotten the punchline, or was suffering from some catastrophic mental breakdown, had they, that is, not realised that an election is imminent.
Sometimes ebay is a pain, but I'd hate to go back to the days of garage sales.
Now, "making an example" of someone, to me, is the stuff of wartime prison camps. Not civil courts in peacetime. You cannot reasonably over-punish a high-visibility convict to deter those who might follow. Not fair. Nor, of course, could punishment by proxy be justified, supposing it were provable. Fact is, though, that a young man who clearly has some problems is being locked in with people who are more likely to supplement his trauma than to show him the way to enlightenment. And we are paying for it. I would say that the law is an ass. But I don't want to be in contempt of court, do I?

Atheists themselves admit this. Thus having no possible proof of their position, it requires blind faith alone to sustain it. Incredible arrogance is also within them to assume there is no God.

Google now has a head start on its rivals in the fiercely competitive cloud computing market, thanks in part to deals inked with the US Patent and Trademark Office and the General Services Administration in the past year. In both cases, Google enjoyed the benefits of support from federal chief information officers. In both cases, a few people involved in the process voiced objections.

We join together in meditation and prayer this morning seeking to realize that the fabric of our lives is woven by our own hands, every thought, every word, every action is a thread in the social tapestry. So as we weave let us always be mindful that each and every thread is a contribution, our contribution, to the whole. Amen.

This took me a long time to figure out because my family is not like that. No- in my family we are serious when we say stuff like that. We are honest. And rude. The rudeness is the downside- the upside is you always know if you are supposed to bring a gift or not.
Then you see something like this happen. And you kinda step back and think about how racism rolls off your back. Like water in a thunderstorm. And it's only when something like this happens that you get soaked. Although you've been walking in the storm your whole life.
But then something else happened. That same baby that was gifted to her from heaven, the one she felt growing and moving in her womb, the same child that gave her pleasure every time he said 'mama', fell ill and died, in her lap.
If you buy into the idea of an economic collapse that allows some sort of plausible, individualistic retreat scenario, you are probably also going to like Crawford's EMP scenarios, even if the most obvious EMP scenarios would normally include enough regular style nukes to melt the planet.

Meet Samantha. But we hardly ever call her that. Mostly, we call her Little D. That's D, for Diva. Because it's all about her. After a long weekend visiting family in Pennsylvania, we came home and adopted her at the humane society. There, she was named Thelma. You can plainly see that name just didn't suit her. (Actually, I wanted to name her Tootsie and the hubby wanted to name her Tarot. Then I jokingly suggested Samantha because she was being a little naughty at the time - she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter. Anyway, I said to my hubby that we should call her Samantha because "naughty girls need love too". Ha. What can I say, I was a teenager in the 80s.)

The Kingdom of God starts small, a grain of wheat, a mustard seed, a leaven in the loaf. And it spreads, oh, yes, it grows. But it starts small, even hidden in the secret places, a knitting together of wonder, perhaps. A candle on a lamp stand, a woman searching for a coin, a man in a field with a treasure worth selling everything to possess.

The mean average is where a random variable is most likely to land. The further you stray from the mean, the less likely you are to find something landing that far out. So, any kid who scored highly is much more likely to come closer to the 25% mean average next time.

Let's examine the second half of the video. One protester calls out 'Mic check!,' and everyone knows what this means. This guy will speak for us, he has something to say. And if they disagree, they can simply stop passing this person's words along. But in this case he speaks words of de-escalation. We will let you police leave. He's teaching the police a lesson in non-violence. It's amazing to see this at work.

But as our journey began to unfold, God laid it on our hearts to be open to adopt children that others have looked over. Although initially intimidated at the thought of the unknown, we began asking questions. Lots and lots of questions.

Icehouse: Hey Little Girl
I started with Indus, an IPA. It looked to be pouring a bit flat and it took a bit of coaxing to get a loose-bubbled head to form on the top. It didn't last long. However the beer really benefits from the low carbonation as it creates a wonderful cask-like effect, with just enough sparkle to push the flavours out. Naturally enough, it's hops out front: good honest English varieties by the taste of them, with lots of floral orange blossom laid on quite intensely, creating almost a resinous burn while staying clean and crisp, avoding all harshness. At 4.6% ABV it's around a percentage point weaker than the likes of White Shield and Bengal Lancer, but I'd regard it as being very much in the same league. The balance of marmalade and toffee you get in the others isn't present here, but the hop punchiness makes up for it for me. Tangy, sinkable and with a lasting bitterness, I really enjoyed it.
It's also not clear how much we should cheer the 64.6 percent increase in the number of Black-owned non-employer firms. Average revenues at these firms dropped 10.7 percent in real terms between 2002 and 2007. Perhaps more importantly, in 2007 the average revenue at a Black-owned non-employer firm was only $18,500 (in 2002 dollars).

I had never seen so many hippies in one place outside Central Park. We were all over the grounds and buildings, setting up tents and campsites outdoors and inside, utilizing the communal kitchen, and playing together everywhere. Perhaps what amazed me most during that week was how careful we were to keep the place clean, how nothing was trashed or damaged, how all of us were committed to leaving the grounds as we'd found them or even better.
The only catch? On Passover, we're not allowed to eat bread. This has to do with the part of the Passover story where the Jews wander the desert, and are unable to make leavened bread. By not eating bread for seven days, we pay tribute to what our ancestors had to suffer during their exodus.
Last week he took his two-man crew downstairs and they tore out the knotty pine paneling on the outside backyard wall, took up all the 1970's basement shag carpeting, tore down the ceiling tiles (which had been falling down on a regular basis anyway) and moved in a dumpster to get rid of the debris.
There was a problem, though, in that, when they were attempting to insert a guide wire-thing into her esophagus, they popped a hole in her LARYNX. So, they had to take out all their guides and scopes and instruments while the doctor consulted with another laparoscopic doctor and an ENT to decide if this was a big deal. Apparently, it should heal on its own, provided there isn't any infection, so they just sewed up the hole, put everything back in, and finished the operation; hence, FIVE AND A HALF HOUR surgery.

Again, 'racial tension' doesn't need 'stirring up' - it already is stirred up! But not quite. It isn't racial tension that's the problem; but Muslim-non-Muslim relations. Oldham has a problem with this divide which it shares with nearly all north-western cities and towns. And Muslim self-ghetto-isation, again, is the main cause of these problems.
I finally switched on my computer (largely because I had an e-mail from a French friend that asked why there were no results) and found the HuffPo summary immediately. No surprises. Labour making gains at the government's expense - it was expected and is not unusual for local elections around half-way through a government's life. Under the Thatcher government this used to happen quite often yet the lady went on to lead her party to victory several times.

Scientists at Rothamsted are trialling a variety of GM wheat that produces a pheromone that aphids don't like. Aphids eat wheat, and reduce crop yields. If you can stop them from going near the wheat, then the yields should be higher. As a pre-emptive strike, I'm going to point out that the gene added to the wheat occurs naturally in many species of plant. It is not, as has been said, a 'cow gene'.
For the good of the state, the people of Sarawak and the Barisan Nasional performance in the coming GE, it is pertinent that the leaders in PBB who are not aligned with Taib and those of the other BN component parties discuss an alternative state leader vis-a vis Taib.
After passing a few awful sicknesses back and forth we are ready for spring more than ever! Today was chilly but the sun was shining and the birds were chirping...so it's coming. This past weekend I put the remainder of the "winter" decorations away and made room for a couple new springy plants.

Dad went for a walk around when we got there and mum and i got the boys into their swimmers. Then Jordy was straight in the river and wanting to go floating off downstream. Mum had Darcy and i was still getting ready to get in and Jordy is off! Little bugger. I was a bit worried about him going over the edge of the waterfall but i met him down the end and he kicked over to me. Not that it was a big waterfall! He would not have been hurt if he went over but he might have scared himself.
And so I began. I used the instructions I found online as my chief guide but after three days I was a little skeptical that the sour dough had fermented enough or produced enough yeast. My Twitter friend Finn said that he had been feeding his starter ("Veruca") for 12 days and it was now time. So I asked him if he thought my starter was ready? He confirmed what I thought and said no. So I've been letting "Finn Jr". grow and grow. Last night he became a rebellious teenager and we woke up to him trying to escape the safety of his jar to explore the world (thus the picture above this posting).
The meal was simple to produce, and lovely to eat.
He also sought to break from the class-conscious conventions of the 1930s and early 40s, when top hat and tails or tuxedos were the norm, by dancing in casual or everyday work clothes, so as to make his dancing more relevant to the cinema-going public. As his first wife, actress and dancer Betsy Blair explained: "A sailor suit or his white socks and loafers, or the T-shirts on his muscular torso, gave everyone the feeling that he was a regular guy, and perhaps they too could express love and joy by dancing in the street or stomping through puddles.he democratized the dance in movies."[14] In particular, he wanted to create a completely different image from that associated with Fred Astaire, not least because he believed his physique didn't suit such refined elegance: "I used to envy his cool aristocratic style, so intimate and contained. Fred wears top hat and tails to the manner born - I put them on and look like a truck driver."[2]

I have slowly been making progress on my Modern She Made Swap project. I am going to try and finish the rest of the paper piecing by tomorrow evening. Once I get my partner's feedback, I will either be turning this beauty into a mini quilt or pillow cover. Who knows, I might even add some hand quilting in there as well!
I set a target number and gave the child that number of flies to spill onto a desktop. We started with 5 flies. I made a worksheet to record a fly addition sentence: Dead Flies + Live Flies = How Many Flies Altogether? I put the paper in a page protector so we could change the target number. The picture matches the type of flies I found, but I think you could use it with any plastic fly. As long as kids record the upright flies in one column and the upside down flies in the other column, they're good to go. I mean fly!
I just love it and I think I have found a new passion. Tranferware! I have a few pieces but definitely will keep my eye out for more to go in my collection. One thought is to make this into a lovely sink for a powder room in our new one-day home. Hubby also came home with these:
Then Tyson turned around and I noticed something.
My mobile phone rings. It's my daughter's school. She has fallen over and has "a small hole" in her head. I finish my work at ten times the usual speed (I'd like to know how to do that) and head for the nearby hospital. On the roads, nobody seems to understand I'm in a rush and cars loiter and arc lazily. When I arrive finally, she is sitting on her teacher's lap, draped in a blanket as they wait to be seen. She seems dazed. I hug her and take a look at the cut. It looks as though she has been caught by a stray stud in a ruck. Her teacher tells me how loud the thump was when her head hit the floor, which is not something I really want to recap.

You see, New Years Eve dinner was kind of the beginning of my birthday celebrations, because all those years ago, my mother was in labour that night.. giving birth to me 5 hours after midnight. a New Years day baby. this day, 54 years ago, I was preparing to come into the world. Each New Years Eve, I would wear a new dress and party shoes.. feeling very much a princess. I felt special because of Peter's hospitality

But then something else happened. That same baby that was gifted to her from heaven, the one she felt growing and moving in her womb, the same child that gave her pleasure every time he said 'mama', fell ill and died, in her lap.
I learned about Oh My Melodies from Espousal Records' Kyoungmo Kim as he updated me on the current whereabouts of the members of emo pop band I Love JH. I was instantly charmed by what I heard and returned to listen every now and then. Recently this has happened more frequently, and for reasons that will become obvious tomorrow I found the perfect opportunity to find out more about Oh My Melodies straight from the source:
Then finally, they put me on depakote. I am mentioning this drug by name because I have heard from several other women that they believe depakote was the cause of this for them too, and a doctor at a California University said that he strongly, strongly believes that it gives PCOS to young women. Then I heard that some doctors have been instructed not to prescribe it to women under 40. Depakote won't own up to that and they knowingly let the doctors prescribe it (at least, until recently from what I hear). I don't want to get into who my sources are because I don't want to get anyone in trouble. It's very good for seizures, my brother had to take it for years and it kept him alive, but for Bipolar- not so much.

Charlene M. Proctor: When we bring more light into the body, there is a corresponding emotional and biological reaction. Old barriers, physical blocks, and emotional patterns come to the surface in order to be released. The dark night of the soul represents a cleansing of the personal unconscious in preparation for a deeper descent of light, and is usually considered as a prerequisite for the deeper stages of spiritual mastery.

It's been a while - since December, in fact - since I pulled out the brew equipment. Well, with the return of summer, and my recently purchased, though not yet assembled MLT, the time has come to make some beer. Now, the little Brew Devil inside of me is pulling me in a few different ways, and I have a couple of obligations to previously conjured brews, so the brew schedule is filling up fast. Here's a quick run down.

Personally, I am a fan of books like this that help bridge the gap to help children graduate from reading Bible picture books to actually digesting Scripture. And while it is not a homeschool "curriculum", it would certainly adapt well as a Bible curriculum, especially if your family enjoys the New Living Translation. On the other hand, children this age are incredibly impressionable. They are thinking and absorbing so much. It is time to sharpen up on your theology. I have read some Bible storybooks where the stories are retold in a way that uses soft theology or even sways the story by adding (or omitting) details to the original text. The mere fact that someone picks and chooses only certain Bible stories to retell means that the person has at least some control of what the final presentation looks like. In this book, Carolyn Larsen has condensed the Scripture to retell each story, but (as you can see from the one example above) she is merely eliminating details that may cause a young brain (or even my old brain) to scatter and wander. It brings the story focus, and keeps the truth. Larsen has taken the opportunity to use the "Now What" section to tie in the big picture of the Gospel right from the beginning. For me, this is an essential element that I look for in a good book. One of the first things I did was flip to the back of the book to the stories telling of Jesus' death and resurrection and the early church. I read through the "Now What" sections looking for any details that may tell my child how or why to become saved. At first, it appeared that I wouldn't find what I was looking for. Disappointed, I flipped to Genesis. There it was. With the telling of Adam and Eve's sin, came the Gospel. Right at the beginning, exactly where it was needed. We need a Savior and here's why and here is where you can find Him.

Pevan's lip curled as she realised the other woman had jumped expecting Pevan to close the Gate beneath her, not bothering to choose an arc that would bring her to safe ground of her own accord. They certainly would need to have a chat about discipline. Still, there was no time for the horseplay of letting the Four Knot fall back through again. She snapped the Gate shut, and even then Notia stumbled on landing.

I'm sitting here at 10am in a condo that is much more empty than it was 12 hours ago. My tv is gone, my coffee table is gone, and most importantly the boxes of my exes stuff that i had hidden behind the couch for the past 5 months is gone. I didn't know how it would go today. My last relationship was a tricky one. I'd have to say it was honestly the worst and most dysfunctional relationship I've ever had in my entire life (i've had a total of 3 boyfriends).

Jupiter owns Pisces, and the Moon owns Cancer. This is another reason why Cancer is an even better place for Jupiter than Pisces. Huh? That sounds backwards? No, there is a very important lesson to learn here! You may be as great as a planet, but you never achieve your zenith of potential except in partnership with other people. It is in cooperation with the energies of other people that we can rise to greater heights than we can on our own. And this is yet another factor making Cancer, not Pisces, the exaltation sign of Jupiter.

The ideas employed in foul play are given a false foundation but one that is seemingly real. They depend on the person to whom they present the ideas to mistake the reality. Thus the targeted person believes their somatic reactivity is evidence that the idea is real. And this is generally true. If we sense danger for instance, even though we don't have sensory information our body will move to fear because that is natural. It is the preparation of our body to face and deal with the danger. In foul play the danger card is play to cause the targeted person to mistakenly believe that the presented idea, of which they are more conscious, has led to their somatic arousal. This empowers the ideas. In reality the danger posed and the idea presented are unrelated. It is through trickery that the person targeted is brought along to believing in the ideas presented. And you will see that with certainty when you are no longer unsuspecting of the foul play having done the experiments and having seen how easily you can be manipulated while believing the medical misinformation. And that includes the psychiatric babble about misreading others if you are suspicious. What they are effectively saying is that you have to accept appearances at face value. That's self-serving garbage. When you have done the experiments and "wised up" or "level up" to use PC game parlance, then the foul game can't be played as to obtain a result. You can "walk through the valley of the shadow of death and fear no evil"! A knowledgeable person can stand against the evil mobs and win. I am living proof of that but you need to see that for yourselves. It is good for you to be sceptical of what I am presenting but please also be curious. This is not about some academic pursuit; this is a life and death matter. To be empowered and reap the benefits for yourselves you must realize the truth and not just know it.
I end these musings with a parable I wrote several months ago when I saw then the tendency to hide behind our procedures rather than to step boldly into Holy Truth.
But she admitted it's getting increasingly more difficult to keep the campaign going. Neither she nor her partner, Dave Mahon, have been able to work since Amy disappeared, but they have spent a fortune. "How much?" I ask. "Oh, easily over 200,000," she replies. She tells me that Dave was able to check his mobile phone and see that he alone has spent 10,000 on credit for it since January 2008.

Last week he took his two-man crew downstairs and they tore out the knotty pine paneling on the outside backyard wall, took up all the 1970's basement shag carpeting, tore down the ceiling tiles (which had been falling down on a regular basis anyway) and moved in a dumpster to get rid of the debris.
09 Your So Good To Me
The day of the big dance, the twins are instructed to clean their rooms and while doing so, Elizabeth discovers George's letter to Enid. Using her mad Jessica Fletcher skillz, she finally deducts that it was her unhinged sister that told Ronnie about George. Of course, instead of confronting her like a normal person, Elizabeth begins to plot her revenge. Seeing as the last book established her unique brand of crap vengeance, she's probably just planning to hide Jessica's hairbrush or something.

When your boyfriend or potential boyfriend is an MD, all the more will a girl's Nancy Drew side act up. An MD is exposed to guests of all colors, shapes and sizes. It's not unlikely that an MD will be tempted to cheat on his partner. Hence, researching in this case could be a girlfriend's defense mechanism.
Pevan's lip curled as she realised the other woman had jumped expecting Pevan to close the Gate beneath her, not bothering to choose an arc that would bring her to safe ground of her own accord. They certainly would need to have a chat about discipline. Still, there was no time for the horseplay of letting the Four Knot fall back through again. She snapped the Gate shut, and even then Notia stumbled on landing.

With Britain looking increasingly likely to secure possession of Palestine, it paved the way for the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a letter addressed to Victor's uncle, Lionel Walter Rothschild, which promised that His Majesty's government would do their utmost to establish 'a national home for the Jewish people' in Palestine. It was a 'declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations', and ultimately led to the creation of Israel. Today Balfour Day is celebrated there on November 2nd.

I've really enjoyed watching the team play this season. These are the five seniors on the team. The team is only allowed to send one gal to the individual singles and one team to doubles. Caroline (on the right) is playing in the singles match today - she is seeded #5 in the state! The gal on her right - Kelsie - is playing doubles today. The doubles team is seeded #2.

It is difficult to make a living from writing. I haven't cracked it yet, although I can see my income growing as I get more interest from foreign publishers and - crucially - manage to keep on producing books. If I compare it, though, to my career in journalism, I'm quite happy. Although I could earn considerably more with a staff job on a national newspaper (and they aren't any easier to come by than getting a book deal), my salary would be pretty much my limit. Whereas a book..well, anything could happen. It's possible for a book to earn for you again and again - a foreign sale here, a film deal there - while you're working on other stuff.

A pipe dream, I know, as so many see the wheels as an extension of their existence. Could one really expect all the insecure men fearful about the size of their penises to not hop into these big trucks so they can feel big in the world? It is human men like this who are behind the wars and the need t smash things.
Parts of the country are already drier than they were in the summer of 1976, when Britain experienced its worst drought for more than 100 years. Then water shortages led to standpipes being installed on residential streets, water supplies to businesses being rationed and schools having to close early.
And the ending was fantabulous! A lot like Deathly Hallows. I only have one complaint here--and that is the writing. Not anything on a whole, but there were instances where Kagawa, to describe emotion, would write 'anger flared' and other feelings in the same way and it came off as kind of passive. It just distracted me a bit.

He also sought to break from the class-conscious conventions of the 1930s and early 40s, when top hat and tails or tuxedos were the norm, by dancing in casual or everyday work clothes, so as to make his dancing more relevant to the cinema-going public. As his first wife, actress and dancer Betsy Blair explained: "A sailor suit or his white socks and loafers, or the T-shirts on his muscular torso, gave everyone the feeling that he was a regular guy, and perhaps they too could express love and joy by dancing in the street or stomping through puddles.he democratized the dance in movies."[14] In particular, he wanted to create a completely different image from that associated with Fred Astaire, not least because he believed his physique didn't suit such refined elegance: "I used to envy his cool aristocratic style, so intimate and contained. Fred wears top hat and tails to the manner born - I put them on and look like a truck driver."[2]

At about ten o'clock in the morning the sun threw a bright dust-laden bar through one of the side windows, and in and out of the beam flies shot like rushing stars.You don't usually read that kind of thing in a play. But there isn't a lot of it, and so the overall effect is streamlined and minimal- no philosophical rambling or wordy imagery. Big hearts for Steinbeck in this department. I want to read more novel-plays. (Recommendations please!)

Let me pause for a moment. I'm sure that many of you feel that an evening out can be a very much needed thing. I am even sure that it can be well deserved too. But what I haven't told you yet is that that was the first time in four days I had seen Jack.
Another one that has crept up in the last 2-3 years is where I can be, physically and literally exist and take up Jaime-shaped space, based on the weather. If it's a day I'm working from home and it's sunny, I cannot be in my house. I pace around hugging the cat and feeling "off" and unproductive even if I'm getting work done.

The point here is surely not to deride empiricism. Heaven knows conservatism could stand to quit leading with its heart and start thinking more empirically about the world as it is, not the world as they wish it to be. The point, if I'm reading them correctly, is that too many leading voices on the left give themselves over to wonkiness, and presume that their moral convictions are widely shared, such that the only reason anybody could disagree with them is through ignorance (willful or not), or malice.
The weather's been beautiful this past week: blue skies, sunshine, rising temperatures. It's even been warm enough to eat lunch outside. It's really hard to believe that last year at this time, we still had a bit of snow. Of course, the cold can come back anytime, but for now, it's the most beautiful spring weather.

So I pondered and scratched out various possibilities, and casually read through various texts by and about Che or Abe, wondering what the most suggestive, poetic and concise way of connecting these two men across time and history could be, until one day I hit on something that I just knew was right. It was a quote, by Che, in reference to his trip to New York City in 1964 to address the United Nations' General Assembly. It seems that while he was in New York there were two attempts on his life, one by a man wielding a gun and one by a woman with a knife. When asked about these attacks by a journalist, he is said to have responded with a smile and a bemused wisecrack: "It is better to be killed by a woman with a knife than a man with a gun" said Che.

The ideas employed in foul play are given a false foundation but one that is seemingly real. They depend on the person to whom they present the ideas to mistake the reality. Thus the targeted person believes their somatic reactivity is evidence that the idea is real. And this is generally true. If we sense danger for instance, even though we don't have sensory information our body will move to fear because that is natural. It is the preparation of our body to face and deal with the danger. In foul play the danger card is play to cause the targeted person to mistakenly believe that the presented idea, of which they are more conscious, has led to their somatic arousal. This empowers the ideas. In reality the danger posed and the idea presented are unrelated. It is through trickery that the person targeted is brought along to believing in the ideas presented. And you will see that with certainty when you are no longer unsuspecting of the foul play having done the experiments and having seen how easily you can be manipulated while believing the medical misinformation. And that includes the psychiatric babble about misreading others if you are suspicious. What they are effectively saying is that you have to accept appearances at face value. That's self-serving garbage. When you have done the experiments and "wised up" or "level up" to use PC game parlance, then the foul game can't be played as to obtain a result.

Ok, so I know I've already done a section on Bendis' New Avengers (and The Mighty Avengers)but I feel like a wanna do a brief recap as #26-#31 as just been collectively released as 'REVOLUTION'. I'm a big fan of The New Avengers,but I gotta say it reads better in trade form than it does in single issues(lets be honest,most of Bendis' single issues you can read in less than 5 minutes),the flashback style narritive sits a lot easier and the constant scapes with Electra and the Hand makes it a lot pacier and this is easily the best storyline since 'BREAKOUT'(ok, you gotta love 'Secrets and Lies').
As Grace picked out clothing for Doris to wear, Doris looked at the blouse Grace had chosen with disgust and said, "Grace that has to be the ugliest blouse I have ever seen! Is that yours?" "This is your favorite blouse Mom. You've had it for over two years and worn it at least a hundred times." Grace replied as she held up the garment. "That isn't mine. I have never seen that blouse before in my life. Why would you say such a thing?" No one knows what she was thinking, but Doris wasn't about to admit that she had forgotten. As she put on her socks Doris asked, "Did you check the mail, Grace?" "Yeah, Mom, Bubba brought it to you over an hour ago." Grace answered as she walked over and picked up the mail and showed it to Doris.

The yellow shoes I made were turned, literally. Made inside out, then flipped. The outer sole is stitched directly to the uppers. This style is around and fashionable for all of our time period. It is the least durable, since it cannot be re-soled and has to have a thinner sole to be able to be turned. However, this makes it the daintiest of shoe styles.

Today the kids cut or tore colorful tissue paper and glued them to their heart-shaped boxes ($0.99 each at my local craft store). I took them home today and Mod Podged them to seal and make them shiny...Tomorrow, the kids will pick out letters to spell M-O-M (or M-A-M-I or G-R-A-N-N-Y, depending on their own special person's name) from my collection of small foam letter stickers to decorate the top. They will also decorate a bag to 'wrap' it in. And voila, Happy Mother's Day! I think they'll be super cute when they're done.

Eating Disorders are serious, life-threatening illnesses - not choices - and it's important to recognize the pressures, attitudes and behaviors that shape the disorder. Would you recognize if your friend or family member had an eating disorder? Parents, siblings and close friends play a significant role in guiding and supporting someone with an eating disorder. In many cases, individuals with eating disorders cannot recognize a need for help in themselves, and it takes a strong, caring individual to reach out. Most importantly, you need to know that there is hope. For those seeking recovery for a loved one, eating disorder treatment is available.

Just this morning Jason and I were marveling at the fact that once we do have kids, there is no "going back". Right now we have the pleasure of enjoying each others' company. Once we have kids, that dynamic will not go away, but it will be different. Once you're a parent you never stop being a parent - whether you're 20, 40, or 60. What an incredible blessing and responsibility that is! And at times, what a burden. That's where we come in.

Down on the bay shore, Henry Yesler had been operating his sawmill since about two years ago. He had shut the machine off for the day, for this was a day like no other. He would soon join a few others of his American associates, to sign a treaty with the natives whose ancient lands were all around. Chief Seattle would arrive to represent the Duwamish and Salish peoples; he was known among the new settlers as a reasonable man, a leader who understood the tectonics of this moment's history.

Here it is. The real purpose of the visit to Pho 68. Pho with rare beef and braised beef. It looked the part, and tasted it too. They've got the makings of a really good pho here. The stock was excellent. Deep, aromatic and intensely savoury. Wafer thin slices of beef were rare on arrival but cooked through as time progressed, the gentle poaching keeping them tender. The braised beef (brisket I think) was also sliced thin, but had a stronger, minerally flavour. The tendon running through it was soft and gelatinous speaking of long, slow cooking. The noodles, save for a little gluey clump at the top, were cooked just right.

At around dusk, Emi asked if I wanted to go for a walk in the woods, and of course I said yes. We picked up a friend of hers on the way. It rained this afternoon, and everything had that fresh, sweet smell that you always get after rain in the spring time. The Peepers were deafening as we picked our way through the slick mud, over wet rocks, and through damp grasses, fending off mosquitoes as we went. Emi tried to catch a frog (it was brown, though we're not sure what type it was.) as we wound our way through the flooded areas, looking for peepers and other frogs. We saw the colour of the sky through the trees as the sun set.

Jupiter owns Pisces, and the Moon owns Cancer. This is another reason why Cancer is an even better place for Jupiter than Pisces. Huh? That sounds backwards? No, there is a very important lesson to learn here! You may be as great as a planet, but you never achieve your zenith of potential except in partnership with other people. It is in cooperation with the energies of other people that we can rise to greater heights than we can on our own. And this is yet another factor making Cancer, not Pisces, the exaltation sign of Jupiter.

Prayers for forgiveness were said, and my parents were advised to stop crying as it wouldn't bring me back. I watched my Mom cry and weep all night as she asked God why He Had to take my life.

Reaching goals requires motivation. ZenHabits does a nice job of explaining motivation, as well as ways to achieve it and sustain it during times of struggle. To find out more about motivation, check out the self-motivation quiz from Mindtools. After the quiz, there is a nice explanation of factors involved in self-motivation including: self-confidence and efficacy, positive thinking, focus, and environment. The author from the article How Self-Motivated Are You noted, "Self-motivation doesn't come naturally to everyone. And even those who are highly self-motivated need some extra help every now and then. Build your self-motivation by practicing goal-setting skills, and combining those with positive thinking, the creation of powerful visions of success, and the building of high levels of self-efficacy and self-confidence."

And let's face it, this ain't Fifty Shades of Grey I'm living out here in the exurbs, either. Sometimes the most exciting thing that happens involves wire, mesh and a recalcitrant dishwasher named Paco.

Boris you beauty! Bojo's latest epistle in the DT opens with him at the ArcelorMittal Orbit structure in Stratford; "This sculpture is a masterpiece, far better and more rewarding up close than it appears at a distance". However, he goes on to reveal "everything that is wrong with the BBC and with this country"...and speaking "as one who has just fought a campaign in which I sometimes felt that my chief opponent was the local BBC news"!! Please read what he says about the BBC, Blair and Brown. An opinion which I share of course...
My mom found a pair of these adorable tree trunk side tables at Goodwill for $15. They had weird rectangular black glass tops and the tables themselves were all chipped up.
Having just been exposed to tombs, mummies and the world of Hatshepsut full-throttle in a middle school text book, it seemed more fitting than ever to face the crowds and potential chaos with three kids ages 6 - 11, all in the name of seeing the real thing. And, with no more strollers or diapers to consider, it was well worth the attempt.

"African economies easily rank among the most resilient in the world. In the middle of the 2009 global economic recession, Africa was the only region apart from Asia that grew positively, at about 2%.

Dad went for a walk around when we got there and mum and i got the boys into their swimmers. Then Jordy was straight in the river and wanting to go floating off downstream. Mum had Darcy and i was still getting ready to get in and Jordy is off! Little bugger. I was a bit worried about him going over the edge of the waterfall but i met him down the end and he kicked over to me. Not that it was a big waterfall! He would not have been hurt if he went over but he might have scared himself.

Pat colored this lovely frog more times than you can imagine today. Here's one of her little green friends that I managed to catch on camera before it hoped away. This frog was colored with light green, shaded with dark green, then Pat dabbed some colorless blender onto a rag and added the fine texture.
In many ways it is a typical love story, yet the pain Logan goes through as a result of his service to the USA gives it such a current and poignant flavor. I appreciated the fact that this heroic character was written with flaws as well.

Those who see the injustice of the CDF's attempt to suppress LCWR need to respond with similar courage. Now is not the time to be afraid, worried, or despairing. We must rely on our God who promised to be with us and guide us in our times of need. The only thing we can ever change is ourselves and our responses, not other people or situations. We have the choice at this juncture to respond with courage.
Even more importantly I think I'm having a rebirth of my spirit. For the longest time I've basically just existed. I've done the bare minimum around the house. It's been a struggle to get that done too. But the last few weeks I've been WANTING to spread my wings and take the time to make the homemade breads and the homemade snacks. I've been wanting to do that stuff. It's almost like I'm being reborn. I don't know what has brought this about. I'm afraid to blink...afraid that it will go away if I do. I still have all the stress and depression in my life....but I'm really trying to not let it affect ME. And maybe that's the whole difference.

I'm stealing a line from a song title today-the famous "Rainy Days and Mondays" by The Carpenters, 1971. Can't you just hear the tune in your head now? If you can, then I can assure you that it's probably going to be playing in there a long time! Or at least that's what happens to me when I am reminded of a song I like-the lyrics and music dance in my brain for hours at a time before fading away, often to appear again when I am trying to fall asleep in the middle of the night. Curses! My brother calls this phenomena 'ear worms'.an image I actually don't even like to think about!

Hmm where do I start from? where? where? where.? Oh yeah, there!. So I'm quite certain that every believer knows what "New Creation" means (at least I hope so). When asked to define the term, words like "born-again", "salvation", "repentance", "baptism" etc are bound to be used in the definition. That's all good but who really is the "NEW CREATURE"? The creation story helped me understand this better so let's start from there. Once upon a time, God created man (and woman), gave him authority over everything on earth (Genesis 1:27-31) and placed him in the Garden of Eden where man could be close to HIM (GOD) all the time. One day, the enemy of God (and all God's children), satan, tricked man into sinning against God. Satan gave man "sin and the pleasures that come with it" and in return man gave up his authority over earth and everything in it, hence, man came under the rulership of satan. Uhmm.. yeah I guess you can call it an exchange. satan brought sin to man and man paid with his authority over the earth. A poor exchange indeed.but hey, it was no robbery. Anyway, satan, having all the authority now, become the ruler of man; and man the slave of satan (Jesus replied, "Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin" John 8:32). Man was forever doomed as a slave of the enemy and like anyone who is sentenced to life imprisonment without appeal, the only way of escape is DEATH. Scary huh? I know! Well, God who created man and loved man in spite of man's disobedience wanted to free His creation from bondage so He had to send no one else but LIFE to set man free. The Son of God, JESUS CHRIST is LIFE (Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the LIFE.John 14:6; "In him was LIFE.John 1:4). JESUS was/is the only ONE who can set man free.WHY? Think of it this way. Man's only hope of escaping the slavery of satan is death and we all know everyone dies but once. You have one chance to live and after that, there is death and judgement etc. God couldn't watch man die in his sins so there had to be another way to set man free and that way is JESUS. Jesus came on the earth as a man, suffered and died.but uh huh, that's the best part. He died not just for dying sake but He died so He could defeat DEATH. He had to defeat death so He could give man a second chance to life. For 3 days He was dead but on the 3rd day, He rose again having won POWER over death."..Whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have EVERLASTING life" John 3:16. Everlasting life is possible in Jesus because He holds both the power of LIFE (because He is LIFE) and DEATH(because He defeated death) in His hands. Any man who then believes in Him is set free from slavery through death but is given another chance to live and is given a NEW LIFE. Jesus creates the old slave who died anew and breathes LIFE again into his nostrils to make him a living soul.(Then the LORD God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being: Genesis 2:7). This is why anyone who is born-again/born in Christ is said to be a NEW CREATURE (Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new: 2 Corinthians 5:17). Just like the first man ever created, the NEW CREATURE is not placed back on in the world he just got freed from, he is placed into a world, a place, a kingdom where he can be close to God again. The NEW CREATURE no longer belongs to the world of sin and slavery (.because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you- John 15:19). The blessings and authority (Gen. 1:28-31) man God first gave to man before the fall is returned to the NEW CREATURE who becomes part of the body of Christ (.and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all- Ephe. 1:20-23). Yup! Not only does the NEW YOU receive freedom and salvation in CHRIST, but you also receive power and authority over satan and his followers. So now you know.The "NEW YOU" who is born in CHRIST is more powerful and more important than can be comprehended. YOU are God's own precious POSSESSION bought at a very high price. YOU are PRICELESS as could be. Turn to HIS WORD to fully know the "NEW YOU" He created.

The biggest emotion, though, is probably regret. Even though I was at the hospital several different times the week before he died, I never found the courage to really talk to him, to tell him that I forgave him for all the bad stuff. For the most part, I put all that behind me a long time ago, and focused on remembering the good times, the memories that can still make me smile. And that man is the one I miss, the man I wish was still here for Amy, to walk her down the aisle, to spoil our grandchildren, to sing to them.....
...His album output slowed in the 1990s, and eventually he stopped releasing albums altogether. In 1993 he and four members of the Afrika '70 organization were arrested for murder. The battle against military corruption in Nigeria was taking its toll, especially during the rise of dictator Sani Abacha. Rumors were also spreading that he was suffering from an illness for which he was refusing treatment. On 3 August 1997, Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, already a prominent AIDS activist and former Minister of Health, stunned the nation by announcing his younger brother's death a day earlier from Kaposi's sarcoma which was brought on by AIDS. More than a million people attended Fela's funeral at the site of the old Shrine compound. A new Africa Shrine has opened since Fela's death in a different section of Lagos under the supervision of his son Femi Kuti...

I was lunching at Gaylords (still there, and still terrific) in Fitzrovia with two contacts, and we were one of just four tables occupied. Afterwards, I strolled round the restaurant-packed area and spoke to some owners. Two admitted they didn't think they'd make it through next year unless things looked up. All said their Christmas bookings were well down before around December 15th. What seemed to be depressing most of them was the total absence of any sign of improvement.

Admiral Ororod did not garner the complete respect of those under him; he had connections, came from a well-to-do family with important political ties, more a bureaucrat with aspirations for a political career than a military career, he ran his detachment more like a business than the military unit it was. He may have been far from the most inspirational of fleet officers, but his politically minded motivations also helped to ensure that the Orion was one of the top training vessels in all the fleet.
Now that a few days have passed, I look back on that Chrysalis weekend with such joy. I don't think about the logistics of it all, I think about how present God was throughout it. With God's help, that weekend was flawless. And as I sat on Sunday listening to these girls talk about how positively affected they were by this weekend.. I knew at that very instant that every bit of sweat and tears was worth it.

I also feel a change coming in me. I prefer to stay at home, or go for a quiet dinner, or watch a movie. I don't like clubbing anymore, or going and getting "wasted" which is what most of my friends do. Nothing wrong with that at all. But I am just not there anymore. My idea of a good night out now is relaxing at home with a good movie, or going to a cinema, or cooking dinner, or going out to eat. If alcohol must be involved, a nice quiet bar where we can sit and talk.

Reaching goals requires motivation. ZenHabits does a nice job of explaining motivation, as well as ways to achieve it and sustain it during times of struggle. To find out more about motivation, check out the self-motivation quiz from Mindtools. After the quiz, there is a nice explanation of factors involved in self-motivation including: self-confidence and efficacy, positive thinking, focus, and environment. The author from the article How Self-Motivated Are You noted, "Self-motivation doesn't come naturally to everyone. And even those who are highly self-motivated need some extra help every now and then. Build your self-motivation by practicing goal-setting skills, and combining those with positive thinking, the creation of powerful visions of success, and the building of high levels of self-efficacy and self-confidence."

The Real Estate agent took us to the block but was a little confused in locating it. So he unravelled the original Estate drawings. They were in a roll form with two pieces of doweling with the parchment attached at each end. The drawings showed a grand community with a Town Hall, Police Station and Post Office located on a huge roundabout. Behind this civic centre were the recreational fields designed for Football, Cricket and Cycling. On the outer section of the football field was to be a flat cycling velodrome.
Ann, or perhaps Jo, said that one impressive thing about the novel was the way that early on we are led to see the Garners as unusually philanthropic slave owners, but later realize that this is just a matter of relativity, and that they have their own cruelties. I said that one of the most horrifying moments for me, though, was not the out-and-out cruelty from which it's easy to distance oneself, but the incident towards the end when Sethe's living daughter Denver goes to the abolitionists' house to ask for work. Here she comes across something which horrifies her: a small statue of a black child with its head pulled back and its lower lip extended to receive coins casually thrown down, ready for paying tradesmen - a figure so like the Little-Black-Sambo collection figures that stood unremarked outside shops and in arcades in my own childhood, that I was pushed up suddenly against my own unconscious collusion in racism.

During the evenings the crickets and cicadas sing. Combined with roosters, hens, ducks, wild birds, yowling skinny cats and the nightly chorus sent up by the campus's dog population this can all add up to quite the racket at bed time. Speaking of ducks, on my walk home from the office yesterday a tiny yellow duckling waddled across the open-air hallway I was threading my way through, looking lost yet determined. I hope he's found his way to safety, it's a jungle out there.

Needless to say, we didn't run classes that week, but it was interesting to see the areas where we would usually hold yoga classes being used instead for BBQs, and the relaxing quiet poolside area being turned into the local evening rum club!

When I was in Phnom Penh recently, I discovered in the guidebook that there was a cafe called the "Lazy Gecko Cafe". I looked it up on the map and saw that it was quite far from where I was staying and also from most of the areas I would be visiting. However, the pull to seek out this lazy gecko was strong and on my final day, I decided to hunt it down and sink a coffee or two.
Given NuLabour's visceral hatred and contempt for the white working class, who's interests so often conflicts with those now much preferred groups, many observers would have assumed that Denham was either making a bad joke and had forgotten the punchline, or was suffering from some catastrophic mental breakdown, had they, that is, not realised that an election is imminent.
I finally switched on my computer (largely because I had an e-mail from a French friend that asked why there were no results) and found the HuffPo summary immediately. No surprises. Labour making gains at the government's expense - it was expected and is not unusual for local elections around half-way through a government's life.

At first, Rebecca Smith was relieved when she got a phone call from an FBI agent. It was October, just a few months after Smith had spent $30,000 on a real estate investment. The woman who sold her the deal, Karen Hanover, hadn't come through on any of her promises, and Smith was worried.

But hey, he came up with the Eagles "Dream Team" nickname last season. Remind me again how that dream turned out.

Then as the conversation wasn't really going to settle anywhere and it was already getting late, I just moved them on to starting to prep the weeks passage. Esther said, we need to talk. So they went into doing personal time with the text and we talked in someone's room. She was visibly distraught and shared her heart that she was upset in the unbelief that had been coming out in our discussion of what to do about large group. At first I was a little taken aback but as she shared her heart and I reflected back on the conversation, I could see that she was right. We had but Jesus back into a box declaring for him what he could/couldnt do in and through our new people hours after having taken him our of the box at fall con. I felt convicted of my own desire to appease people and unbelief of how Jesus could work at UCI. So we came back together with our leaders and Esther shared her heart, her Holy discontent at what had just transpired and it led to a time of repentance from all of our leaders. That would have been cool enough but in the midst of that time, Jesus ministered to the leader I had prayed with at Fall Con by calling out some of the lies he believed about himself being the weak link in the group as we all affirmed him. It was a beautiful moment of the Holy Spirit doing what was on its agenda, not ours. Please pray that we continue to be open to the interruption of the Spirit.
Then Tyson turned around and I noticed something.
Last but certainly not least is Katie from Miss Dixie! Katie was kind enough to agree to post even though she just went on a trip of her own last weekend, too! Her blog is full of shopping tidbits, interiors, and many other things but my favorite part about her blog is all of the personal touches she adds. You should see how she decorated her laundry room and how gorgeous her wedding was. But seriously, if you haven't seen them go right now. Thank you again Katie, you're the best!

TMT, developed over 20 years ago by social psychologists, explains how humans come to cope with death anxiety by developing self-esteem and attributing purpose to life. However, we do this by shoring up our own cultural identities, self-esteem, and frankly become more conservative in the way that we view others who might threaten our world view. So while Dark Tourism might make us feel all the better about being alive, it may make us less tolerant of others which just seems so counter-intuitive.

But even getting out officially isn't easy. I believe that the US and its allies don't really give a tinker's curse about Afghanistan; as far as they are concerned, if the Afghans are intent on living in a barbaric medieval theocracy, where women are treated as chattels, those who don't share the faith of the rulers live in fear of death, and there're more or less continual low-level wars between various tribes, then they're welcome to do so. Admittedly, there is the poppy problem - Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of non-pharmaceutical grade opiates (92% in 2007) and also, incidentally, the world's largest producer of hashish - but, despite all the hype about the so-called War on Drugs, I have a feeling that (for all sorts of reasons, many sordid, which I won't go into here) the US and most other countries can live with that. No, the real problems are the two 500 pound
We can tend to use spirituality like medicine or a hospital. We utilize it only when things aren't going right or when we're suffering financially, emotionally or relationally. Our pain and suffering, however, can be a path to transcending this selfish conception of spirituality into something more. It can make us ask the questions we normally wouldn't ask, and can lead us to bigger and broader questions, such "what's really the purpose of life?" and "how can we avoid suffering?"

This book really was a pleasure to read, a pick up any time kind of read, in between cooking tea or bathing the kids. In fact it took me less than 24 hours to read this book! I've read a lot of stories of abuse over the last few years, to the point that they started to be unshockable. It was nice to have a different take on a child in care. While Cathy as a foster mother is obviously an official role, you wouldn't get a story like this from other 'officials' eg: social workers.

When we allow ourselves to let go of wanting the other to fill us up, when we let ourselves be real, as we are, another energy comes through our body and being. It will charge our entire being with a presence, a force that is absolutely free of wanting. We feel open, grounded, free, humble and powerful - zero and everything. It is as through our body, heart and soul simultaneously flower in reverential awe of the moment. This force is an exquisite expression of the flower of life itself.

I bet you were just a $15-$20 product, but I felt like I was on the road to cooking awesome food when I unwrapped your box. (It was Christmas, I think.) You only had a two year warranty, and, to be honest, I didn't think you'd last past it.

I want to make sure that i am able to uphold my agreement so my aim to eat vegetarian for 4 out of the 7 days of the week. So I will have the weekends to enjoy meat, and one day of the week if i am especially feeling like i need to have a nice burger or something. This effects so many parts of the global environment that it is something that a lot of people need to consider. It will help with energy use, preserving land, animal rights, cut back on unhealthy foods and water pollution.
But Tom Hiddleston. Man, is Tom Hiddleston good. He plays Loki the same way he played the character in Thor, not as a cartoon villain but as an at times sympathetic man torn between the way he regards his brother with both familial love and burning jealousy. There are scenes between Thor and Loki where you can almost see Loki willing to put an end to all of this, but too far in to stop now. Loki is not absolutely a villain, and none of the heroes are absolutely heroes. They all have doubts and moments of cynicism. It's what elevates the movie beyond merely a collection of character moments and an action-packed third act: the continuing thread about what the nature of heroism really is, where it comes from, and how it can be used to affect the world. It was there in Captain America: The First Avenger when Steve Rogers told Dr. Erskine "I don't want to kill anybody. I don't like bullies. I don't care where they're from." It was there when Thor learned how to wield his power for others and Tony Stark conquered his daddy issues.
Friday night we had dinner at Renaldi's on Lincoln, which was perfectly kid friendly and easy! After dinner we went back to Courtney's house for wine and bonding. Courtney has an adorable new apartment in Lincoln Park were the group stayed for the weekend. Sean, Ellie, and John spent some time watching the old Muppet Movie-- getting ready for the new one out this week. We can't wait to see the muppets back on the big screen again!

"African economies easily rank among the most resilient in the world. In the middle of the 2009 global economic recession, Africa was the only region apart from Asia that grew positively, at about 2%. The continent's growth has been on an upward trajectory ever since then- 4.5% in 2010 and 5.0% in 2011.
You know the old phrase, "Stop and smell the roses"? I think stopping to smell the lilacs is even more important since their luscious blooms only happen for a short time each year. I have to remember to jam my nose into their blooms (checking for bees first, of course) and drink up all their sweet fragrance often before it's gone.
Ratcheting up its campaign to make online TV and connected TV supplier contribute to network bottlenecks, Korea Telecom is reported to be asking firms and firms, in particular Samsung, to share in revenues they gain from such services.
My mom found a pair of these adorable tree trunk side tables at Goodwill for $15. They had weird rectangular black glass tops and the tables themselves were all chipped up.
He nods at her proposal and puts his head back into his book.

Before I get lost in embarrassingly worshipful paeans about the pieces on Axl Rose ("with the wasp-man sunglasses and the braids and the goatee, he reminds one of the monster in Predator, or of that monster's wife on its home planet") and Michael Jackson ("a god moves through him; the god enters, the god leaves") and the rest, let me stop and explain.
Written for ages 6 and older this is one of many delightful books in the Katie Woo series. I no longer have children or grandchildren this age but the title reminded me of my 8-year-old granddaughter (kind of a Madame Fullcharge) and I thought she and I would have fun reading it together. She wasn't interested. Said it was too young for her. That might be because she just finishing up her 4th grade brothers book, Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief. Anyway I thought the book was great and I still think she would have enjoyed it. I'll bet if I could have figured out how to get it onto Kindle she may have read it.
And look...
The Valley of Fire certainly sparkled for us. It flickered its red flames and easily entertained us with its powerful array of beauty.
I have slowly been making progress on my Modern She Made Swap project. I am going to try and finish the rest of the paper piecing by tomorrow evening. Once I get my partner's feedback, I will either be turning this beauty into a mini quilt or pillow cover. Who knows, I might even add some hand quilting in there as well!

Ann, or perhaps Jo, said that one impressive thing about the novel was the way that early on we are led to see the Garners as unusually philanthropic slave owners, but later realize that this is just a matter of relativity, and that they have their own cruelties. I said that one of the most horrifying moments for me, though, was not the out-and-out cruelty from which it's easy to distance oneself, but the incident towards the end when Sethe's living daughter Denver goes to the abolitionists' house to ask for work. Here she comes across something which horrifies her: a small statue of a black child with its head pulled back and its lower lip extended to receive coins casually thrown down, ready for paying tradesmen - a figure so like the Little-Black-Sambo collection figures that stood unremarked outside shops and in arcades in my own childhood, that I was pushed up suddenly against my own unconscious collusion in racism.
After a long battle deciding if I wanted to be Toulouse Lautrec I decided to let him be himself and invade a just fun time artist instead. People can say all the crap they want but I still find his art inspiring and fun - not all art needs to be easily solved and defined.

If there was an award for courage in the cricketing world, it should very well be named after Bob Willis. When he was 26, he had operations on both his knees, which meant he was in constant pain whenever he played. In fact, on certain days, he needed to run five miles in order to generate the strength to play. It was only through his will that Willis managed to play and succeed at the top level for nine more years. At 6 feet 6 inches, Willis was an intimidating fast bowler, one of the fastest England have ever produced. His pace, bounce, aggression and swing made him deadly on all kinds of pitches across the world.
The biggest emotion, though, is probably regret. Even though I was at the hospital several different times the week before he died, I never found the courage to really talk to him, to tell him that I forgave him for all the bad stuff. For the most part, I put all that behind me a long time ago, and focused on remembering the good times, the memories that can still make me smile. And that man is the one I miss, the man I wish was still here for Amy, to walk her down the aisle, to spoil our grandchildren, to sing to them.....

Children's Miracle Network Hospitals provide treatment and hope to millions of sick kids each year, in 170 hospitals in Canada and in the United States.
The Royal troops aren't up to much, but are no worse than the Rebels, so don't really merit being Hordes. They use a mix of swords and shields, and polearms, so you could have some Spears if you wanted. Blades seems the best all-round classification, though. The Artillery represents various fanciful weapons employed against Pulgasari, including fireball-hurling catapults, rocket batteries and some amazingly impractical cannon. A magical priestess was also used in an attempt to defeat the monster.

Even more importantly I think I'm having a rebirth of my spirit. For the longest time I've basically just existed. I've done the bare minimum around the house. It's been a struggle to get that done too. But the last few weeks I've been WANTING to spread my wings and take the time to make the homemade breads and the homemade snacks. I've been wanting to do that stuff. It's almost like I'm being reborn. I don't know what has brought this about. I'm afraid to blink...afraid that it will go away if I do. I still have all the stress and depression in my life....but I'm really trying to not let it affect ME. And maybe that's the whole difference.

It was a grade ten class (or the tenth grade as they say down south, a form which always causes me to imagine the voice of James Earl Jones), mostly constituted with boys. Although teenage males can be (ahem - pun warning) boysterous, it was a pretty good class. It was a group that could easily have gotten out of hand, but somehow, we found a way to co-exist, and it actually turned out to be quite a good class.
In his opening remarks, Bloomberg cited his enthusiasm for the arena and "a lot of economic growth, more tax revenues and more jobs." That of course is a bit more complicated.

As stated in his book "The Leadership Engine", Tichy Noel reinforces that learning is a key requirement for developing leadership. We enhance our unique qualities through learning and education. Studying abroad was probably one of the richest experiences of my life. It was a privilege to study for my MBA at Duke, The Fuqua School of Business. It was a unique moment of my life. The globally focused education allowed me to make a deep personal assessment while providing me with an actionable set of global leadership tools. (Not to mention that I met my wife during my MBA, this is awesome).
I first saw this H&M snake-embossed envelope clutch weeks ago at a location in the city, fell in love (who would've thought since I hate snakes?!), but passed because I didn't have my 20% coupon with me. Days later, when I was ready to actually buy, I couldn't find it anywhere in the stores near me. This is what I get for wanting to save $4 lol. I was about to give up when I recently revisited one of the stores and saw they had restocked. Hallelujah!

Geraldo made a statement that African American & Latino parents should know better than to let their children walk around with hoodies on because people will fear them. That's the hood will give people cause to arrest, frisk and/or harass them. He actually stated that the hoodie was as much to blame for Trayvon's murder as is Zimmerman. Yes, you read that right! This fool not only said, but then he tweeted it! Okay, well guess what? Zimmerman is not a police officer. Trayvon did not need to keep his hands and face in plain view of Zimmerman. Zimmerman sought him out and approached him. Trayvon didn't put his hoodie on until he felt someone following him. Before that he was a teenager walking down the street in a sweatshirt on a cold rainy night. Unless the boy was picking a lock or peering through someone's window, I'm not sure how he falls under a suspicious category. So its actually NOT the hoodie's fault.it's actually the ignorant vigilante's fault this boy is dead!
Because children are the same as they've ever been.

At about ten o'clock in the morning the sun threw a bright dust-laden bar through one of the side windows, and in and out of the beam flies shot like rushing stars.You don't usually read that kind of thing in a play. But there isn't a lot of it, and so the overall effect is streamlined and minimal- no philosophical rambling or wordy imagery. Big hearts for Steinbeck in this department. I want to read more novel-plays. (Recommendations please!)
All of the above started flying at me through the phone. Remember, she's never even met him or seen the amount of vomit coming out of him. The last two weeks had already been filled with her judgments about everything from where he was sleeping and how many times we'd left the house. SHE was stressing me out and that isn't helping for milk supply either.

The weather's been beautiful this past week: blue skies, sunshine, rising temperatures. It's even been warm enough to eat lunch outside. It's really hard to believe that last year at this time, we still had a bit of snow. Of course, the cold can come back anytime, but for now, it's the most beautiful spring weather.
The only thing I take comfort from is the fact that there are no more missing pills from the med carts. The right people are getting the right meds at the right time.
An early start for this one at the northern end of Bassenthwaite Lake. There was a heavy mist when I first arrived which slowly lifted. This is twenty minutes from my home so I'm often at the lake's shores with my camera. Very peaceful on this particular morning; did not see a soul.
The Territory is often referred to as the 'Top End' and is also home to 'the Alice' and 'the Red Centre'. It has plenty of 'Outback' and 'Dreamtime Land' and a rather large portion of extreme 'bugger all'. Rainforests and deserts, long gun barrel straight highways, magnificent picture postcard scenery and two centres of population - Darwin at the top bit and Alice Springs in the middle. That's about it.
They must have magical powers. Even when they're standing relatively still, taking a drink of water, I can't get them in focus.

Yet let us analyze these implications in their general form. Starting with an increase in extreme weather, the erosion of soils and weak rock will increase. This will cause more of the imposing landmasses to crumble into the sea leading to an even greater rise in sea level. The changes will exponentially become more and more unpredictable. A chaotic patter will emerge which can never be studied. People will panic, but the plain fact is that nature is beyond their control. Sea levels will rise, temperatures will spike, and weather will be out of control. Everything will seem to be pointing toward an inevitable apocalypse.

For the sake of simplicity I've been writing this story with the subconscious goal of keeping each section of each chapter in a particular characters head. According to my little yellow Post-It notes in Writer I start slipping from that practice here. I slip into floating point of view briefly at the end of this chapter when I venture inside Roland's head for a paragraph. The note tells me I should rewrite, but I've read this section over and over and I don't see the slip of POV as distracting. At this point I am desensitized to any writerly wrong doing I may have performed here. I think the chapter flows properly and the brief switch in POV is harmless. However, I'm not an editor and I'm not reading the story for the first time either. What do you guys think? And do you think that because I called your attention to it?

Charming landscaping. Flanked by a community mosque on one side and the Karachi residence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi on the other, Hilal Park stretches over a hillock. The landscape design, which makes exceptional use of the topography, is the highlight of the Park. A brick path, edged with immaculately pruned topiaries weaves through well-maintained, exotically shaped flower beds, up a hill, and over culverts and wooden bridges that span over the narrow ravines in the rock formations.

Nursing-sadly no. Mama dried up and Jonah wasn't getting nearly enough so we weaned. It was sad but then it was freeing for me. I was either pregnant or nursing for over three years! That's a long time so I was kinda happy to have my body back although I would have nursed longer, as long as he wanted if it had been possible.

Drifting refers to a driving technique and to a motorsport where the driver intentionally over steers, causing loss of traction in the rear wheels through turns, while maintaining vehicle control and a high exit speed. A car is drifting when the rear slip angle is greater than the front slip angle prior to the corner apex, and the front wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or vice versa), and the driver is controlling these factors. As a motor sport, professional drifting competitions are held worldwide. Drift challenges drivers to navigate a course in a sustained sideslip by exploiting coupled nonlinearities in the tire force response.
Well, we never made that myrtle. The problem wasn't the hogs busting us. It was the coyote. One old mangy dog was loitering around the herd. These pigs were big enough not to be bothered by a pesky song dog, but they certainly took notice of him after he caught wind of our activities and bounded away. The coup de grace, though, were the turkeys. A couple hens were holding sentry and naturally took off when they saw us, taking the finally-frightened hogs with them. Wild pigs don't have the best sense of sight, but they're wary enough to recognize something amiss. (And how strange is it to find a coyote, hogs, and turkeys hanging around each other outside of a Disney movie?)

You are transformed into a world where rolling hills, sprawling vineyards, beautiful houses, and quaint villages take over. From lunch with a traditional Italian family to cooking pasta, visiting shops selling ham, cured meats and cheese, tasting wines and visiting a local factory making pasta, Antonio and Gennaro keeps you entertained with their wit and humour in Bologna- their first stop. Next they move on to the South of Italy to the Amalfi coast, where Gennaro grew up. Personally this was the most favourite episode for me. Cooking by the sea side, plucking fresh lemons off the trees and biting into them, preparing a linguine dish on a boat using fresh octopus and mussels which Gennaro collected after his diving expedition and the wit and humour the two Italians share among themselves were absolutely fun to watch. Ah! the ricotta and lemon tart they made in this episode still holds fresh in my memory. Its high up there on my to-make list.

I learned about Oh My Melodies from Espousal Records' Kyoungmo Kim as he updated me on the current whereabouts of the members of emo pop band I Love JH. I was instantly charmed by what I heard and returned to listen every now and then. Recently this has happened more frequently, and for reasons that will become obvious tomorrow I found the perfect opportunity to find out more about Oh My Melodies straight from the source:
The gates leading out of the courtyard are open and hundreds upon hundreds of robots like myself are pouring through them, seeking a life free of chains. I can hear the crack of bullets and the high pitched screams of guards attempting to stop the waves of angry metal, they are crushed like insignificant bugs.

The jury is still out on which was harder, running in 12 degrees, or running 10 miles. I will say this, my legs have gone back to normal, but my nose, a full 24 hours later, is still red. Apparently I have wind burn, but I look sunburned. It's confusing. Whatever. Point? I'm a badass.
I attended the opening night of "Greener" in The Gaiety Theatre last night. I'm always worried about going to comedies. I recall literally wanting to run out of "Run for your wife" in the same theatre many years ago. I like comedy to be intelligent and challenging, making you laugh by pointing out the ridiculousness of life and love, and the frailty and wonder of the human condition, rather than a series of obvious one-liners. I need not have worried. From the moment the four main characters commanded the stage, the atmosphere was electric and the tremendous script carried them along admirably.
Sorry about the tedious post yesterday night, I was trying to keep myself awake, and I failed. I went to sleep shortly afterwards.

In fact, a salad this good far outshines the name "taco" salad. After all, there's no lunch lady ice cream scoop of ground beef. No deep friend shell. No crumbled Fritos or cheddar cheese. Oh no. While those ingredients usually make other taco salads palatable, they would do nothing but disgrace the mere existence of this salad.

The guru, or acaryadeva, as we learn from the bona fide scriptures, delivers the message of the absolute world, the transcendental abode of the Absolute Personality, where everything nondifferentially serves the Absolute Truth. We have heard so many times: mahajano yena gata sa pantha ("Traverse the trail which your previous acarya has passed"), but we have hardly tried to understand the real purport of this sloka. If we scrutinizingly study this proposition, we understand that the mahajana is one, and the royal road to the transcendental world is also one. In the Muaka Upaniad (1.2.12) it is said:
Up and down 1st Saddle. Timed it perfectly as light snowflakes chased me all the way down the mountain and shortly after I got back to my bike and returned to my apartment the snowstorm had started in earnest.

Tennessee invoked the rule for the 1975 season, during the time when the maximum number of scheduled games was eleven. That season, the Vols traveled to Honolulu for their 12th scheduled game, winning 28-6. There were four non-conference games at home on the schedule that season - Maryland, North Texas State, Colorado State, and Utah - with a fifth on the road (UCLA). I don't know which of those four home NC games was the extra one added due to the Hawaii game. I hope it wasn't North Texas State - the worst Volunteer loss I personally ever witnessed.
Not only did I rework that original block, but I have since done more applique' work (that Scrappy Dresden Plate quilt I'm working on requires applique', as do the monthly minis for Sandy's monthly QAL) and now in charge of the design for our next guild Opportunity (raffle) Quilt for 2014. Do you know what I've chosen for us to do? You guessed it if you said, "an applique' quilt"!

Anyway, we soon found out that if you never spoke, the zombie outbreak didn't happen to most people. Much like the movie Pontypool, where the virus had attached to language itself. So a lot of us were walking from room to room, but really keeping conversation at a minimum, or not at all. Things were looking up near the end, but the whole dream was still kind of disturbing.

It's been a while - since December, in fact - since I pulled out the brew equipment. Well, with the return of summer, and my recently purchased, though not yet assembled MLT, the time has come to make some beer. Now, the little Brew Devil inside of me is pulling me in a few different ways, and I have a couple of obligations to previously conjured brews, so the brew schedule is filling up fast. Here's a quick run down.

I wanted to like The Final Countdown a lot more than I did. This is one script, however, that ends up just as a drama, with a couple of intriguing scenes involving aerial recon pictures and historic pictures, and another scene where that captured Japanese pilot suddenly realizes what is going on. It was so close, so often. And the very last scene with the black limo WAS clever, but you expect that at the end of an episode of "Twilight Zone". You expect MORE from all this and World War II.

Can you tell from my reviews recently that it is getting colder outside? I truly love this time of year for beer. Don't get me wrong I love a good APA or IPA in the summer, but even more I enjoy a fine stout or porter during the colder months of the year. I've got a few bottles of this beer and this is my first one in a very long time for review. I am enjoying this beer while watching my Alma Mater Ball State keep their win streak alive against Miami of Ohio.
I end these musings with a parable I wrote several months ago when I saw then the tendency to hide behind our procedures rather than to step boldly into Holy Truth.
I also feel a change coming in me. I prefer to stay at home, or go for a quiet dinner, or watch a movie. I don't like clubbing anymore, or going and getting "wasted" which is what most of my friends do. Nothing wrong with that at all. But I am just not there anymore. My idea of a good night out now is relaxing at home with a good movie, or going to a cinema, or cooking dinner, or going out to eat. If alcohol must be involved, a nice quiet bar where we can sit and talk.
I finally switched on my computer (largely because I had an e-mail from a French friend that asked why there were no results) and found the HuffPo summary immediately. No surprises. Labour making gains at the government's expense - it was expected and is not unusual for local elections around half-way through a government's life. Under the Thatcher government this used to happen quite often yet the lady went on to lead her party to victory several times.

Every time the subject of marriage comes up, I have to shake my head at the single girls I know. Some of them are younger than I am, some of them are my age, some older. They all want that holy grail of dating and relationships - a husband. It's like some crowning achievement. An end game. Life would only be complete if I had a husband.

The ideas employed in foul play are given a false foundation but one that is seemingly real. They depend on the person to whom they present the ideas to mistake the reality. Thus the targeted person believes their somatic reactivity is evidence that the idea is real. And this is generally true. If we sense danger for instance, even though we don't have sensory information our body will move to fear because that is natural. It is the preparation of our body to face and deal with the danger. In foul play the danger card is play to cause the targeted person to mistakenly believe that the presented idea, of which they are more conscious, has led to their somatic arousal. This empowers the ideas. In reality the danger posed and the idea presented are unrelated. It is through trickery that the person targeted is brought along to believing in the ideas presented. And you will see that with certainty when you are no longer unsuspecting of the foul play having done the experiments and having seen how easily you can be manipulated while believing the medical misinformation. And that includes the psychiatric babble about misreading others if you are suspicious. What they are effectively saying is that you have to accept appearances at face value. That's self-serving garbage. When you have done the experiments and "wised up" or "level up" to use PC game parlance, then the foul game can't be played as to obtain a result. You can "walk through the valley of the shadow of death and fear no evil"! A knowledgeable person can stand against the evil mobs and win. I am living proof of that but you need to see that for yourselves. It is good for you to be sceptical of what I am presenting but please also be curious. This is not about some academic pursuit; this is a life and death matter. To be empowered and reap the benefits for yourselves you must realize the truth and not just know it.
At the wheel of Falken Tire's Porsche 911 GT3 RSR, the winning car at Mid-Ohio and Baltimore, Bryan Sellers (USA) posted the ninth quickest time. He contests the race with Porsche factory pilot Wolf Henzler (Germany). "We didn't have an optimal set-up today, but we know that our car and the tyres will perform much better in the race than in the qualifying," explained Bryan Sellers. Wolf Henzler added: "The circuit was very cold over the last days. Today we have sun and the asphalt temperatures were suddenly much higher. That changed everything. Our team still simply lacks the experience of reacting to such changes in a short timeframe."
The Cyclops website also talks of how those selling beer can benefit from the system, to help familiarise them with the drinks they are serving. But if I felt that the staff at an inn or a beer retail outlet were informing me of a beer based merely on a standard formula of graphics and adjectives, I reckon I might feel a little miffed. Particularly when I could have learned that much myself from the Cyclops information printed on the pump clip or the bottle label.
We left Dawson City on Wednesday, July 14th.
I couldn't work out what punch Mercedes used for her hippo legs, so I improvised with the Modern Label punch (very good investment that one!!). I also recently acquired an Ornament punch and can't wait to have a go at the multitude punch-art options that one has opened up for me.

It is difficult to make a living from writing. I haven't cracked it yet, although I can see my income growing as I get more interest from foreign publishers and - crucially - manage to keep on producing books. If I compare it, though, to my career in journalism, I'm quite happy. Although I could earn considerably more with a staff job on a national newspaper (and they aren't any easier to come by than getting a book deal), my salary would be pretty much my limit. Whereas a book..well, anything could happen. It's possible for a book to earn for you again and again - a foreign sale here, a film deal there - while you're working on other stuff.
Keep the Chinese New Year theme going. Bang on a drum by your snow fire. Grab whatever makes a ruckus and traipse through your house, making as much noise as possible. This is a great way to chase away bad luck and make room for good fortune. You can also clean your house for the New Year, but that's not quite as fun.
Color mixing went very fast for this too. I'm getting more confident with it. My blues are greyed with orange, and my reds with green. I'm finding that my blues go toward orange too much, and I think I'm going to start using black and white to grey my colors a bit more along with compliments. It really depends on the color though. Because every color has a cast to it, and isn't a perfect blue or orange, when you mix them to get grey you can get unpredictable results, and I like that, but I want to get more control over it in a more predictable way, so straight up grey should help.
According to this reliable hadith, the cursing of a Muslim constitutes moral depravity. When any Muslim dares to curse another Muslim, this amounts to moral depravity - all the more so when it is done by a scholar, who is considered by some to be a source of authority in Islamic law. He dares to curse, to slander, to make unfounded accusations, and to sanction the killing, execution, and stoning of people. He uses black incitement against a Muslim. This is the height of moral depravity.

After New Year's, we changed over the outside Christmas decorations to Winter decorations.
And sure enough, in no time at all strange things begin to happen: lights turn on and off by themselves, water faucets behave as if they have a mind of their own, and Ted catches brief glimpses of three people who aren't there from the corner of his eye.

As for my back, it was a pinched nerve controlling my left side, one vertebra off 100ths of an inch to cause such a extreme amount of discomfort and one day no walking because I was bent over in such a way it was difficult to walk (it was a Saturday, Thank God).
I spent this past weekend at a retreat at the Seabeck Conference Center. I had to smile as I drove into Seabeck. The business district, if I don't count the Conference Center, consists of only about a half a dozen buildings, but when I arrived in town I was greeted by a small gray building with a bright blue door. White trim around the window caused the red "Espresso" sign to pop. I decided to go inside. The usual rows of flavors were lined up on a shelf; an espresso machine and a barista were visible from behind a tiny counter. Five or six wooden stools filled the remaining floor space- stools that were all occupied by the locals. They are a generous lot. I discovered that they will tease anyone. They didn't penalize me for being a visitor; locals and visitors are all teased alike.
As someone with Type 1 diabetes (the "real" diabetes, as I like to put it -- the kind you can't help getting), I sometimes wonder when I'll end up retiring, or how long I can escape death. So I wonder how much I should be saving for retirement. Will I get the typical 25-30 year long retirement? Or would I have to retire at 40 to pull that one off? If I work until I'm 65, I could have lots put away, only to die within 2 years if I'm lucky, on the other hand.
What if they were to do a study to report a finding of clinically obese people who'd take a year or more off their lives for a "perfect" body? Or people with some sort of birth defect? Or - and perhaps most pertinent to my own situation - transsexuals?
The Chairman of the CFR is Robert E. Rubin, who served under Bill Clinton as Treasury Secretary and headed Clinton's National Economic Council. He was a Clinton crony. Rubin's ties to Clinton are interesting, since Bill Clinton was Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University, where he was close to the Jesuit faculty (became Class President in his junior year). Rubin has served on the board of the Center for National Policy (CNP), which is led by it's President, Roman Catholic Tim Roemer (A graduate of the Roman Catholic University of Notre Dame).
Maybe Facebook should hire Thomas Friedman to do its ads. His ad for Coursera (h/t Indyanna's comment at Historiann's) column on online education pretty much explains why the 100,000-person online class and the flipped classroom, with local professors as glorified tutors, is the way to go. The comments are good, and they ask the same questions we've all been asking and come to some similar conclusions.
We stood outside their house and hugged and prayed over them. I held each of them tight until they cried. They needed a mother's love and protection and the feel of safet, if only for a moment. I kissed them all over their faces and told them I loved them and we would see them again, and help them in the meantime. Isabelle and Johnny begged to give them all the food we had in the van, so we asked them to walk back with us. We walked down that path to the van, praying the whole way. I didn't know until later that night after looking at the pictures that we were all holding hands. Isabelle and Johnny love these girls too, and their hearts were broken and changed that day too.

I rarely bake with apricots but I saw a gluten-free recipe that sounded amazing and one I had to test out asap. In fact, I think this is the one and only apricot recipe on Lemon Drop to date.
Drifting refers to a driving technique and to a motorsport where the driver intentionally over steers, causing loss of traction in the rear wheels through turns, while maintaining vehicle control and a high exit speed. A car is drifting when the rear slip angle is greater than the front slip angle prior to the corner apex, and the front wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or vice versa), and the driver is controlling these factors. As a motor sport, professional drifting competitions are held worldwide. Drift challenges drivers to navigate a course in a sustained sideslip by exploiting coupled nonlinearities in the tire force response.

Can you tell from my reviews recently that it is getting colder outside? I truly love this time of year for beer. Don't get me wrong I love a good APA or IPA in the summer, but even more I enjoy a fine stout or porter during the colder months of the year. I've got a few bottles of this beer and this is my first one in a very long time for review. I am enjoying this beer while watching my Alma Mater Ball State keep their win streak alive against Miami of Ohio.

When the captain of your ship tells you to do something in a somewhat frenzied or stern voice, it's almost always for your own good and everyone else's, so you should just shut your mouth and do it. And not get defensive about it.
What ought to be acutely troubling is that the history of revisions to oil and gas resources has heretofore been one of increases. For the first time, we are now seeing not just downward revisions in estimated natural gas resources, but drastic downward revisions. That should tell us that the era of unlimited horizons for fossil fuels has come to a close. All the advanced technology that was supposed to bring unending plenty in the form of fossil fuels is now giving us better estimates of what will be available, namely, not nearly so much as we thought.

The point of cleavage between those who hold the crude theory of Baptismal regeneration, ex opere operato, and those who maintain what is usually spoken of as the "Hypothetical Theory," lies just here. The former believe that the recital of a formula and the performance of a particular action necessarily produce the spiritual effect of regeneration; the latter hold that where believing prayer is offered for a blessing, which we have reason to believe it is God's will to grant, that prayer will be provisionally answered. The former believe that this spiritual result is absolute, and admits of being neither reversed nor supplemented; the latter maintain that the result, whatever it is, must needs be provisional in its character, and cannot be made absolute until the condition upon which in the case of an adult it is contingent is complied with. The former maintain that the saving effect of this ordinance may be lost by wilful sin; the latter maintain that such saving effects only remain if the condition on which they are contingent is complied with, and, even where wilful sin does not occur, are forfeited by the non-fulfilment of the appointed condition. According to the former theory, no baptized member of our congregations needs to be born again, or, indeed, can be, although his life may be a discredit to our common humanity, and it would seem that the only hope for him lay in the possibility of so radical a change ; according to the other, all who have never consciously exercised faith in the special promise of God made in Baptism need to be told, "Ye must be born again." The difference between the two positions, which may seem to be slight, is really radical. The Gorham judgment given on appeal by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council affirmed that the hypothetical explanation of the formularies of the Church of England was a perfectly reasonable and legitimate one, though it did not affirm that it was the only possible interpretation. See GORHAM CASE.
The mean average is where a random variable is most likely to land. The further you stray from the mean, the less likely you are to find something landing that far out. So, any kid who scored highly is much more likely to come closer to the 25% mean average next time.
My memoir on adopting my daughter from China was perhaps the hardest thing I ever wrote mainly because at the same time that I was trying to understand what was going on, what this sudden unexpected journey in the middle of my life actually meant, to capture in words what it actually felt like- I was trying to get others to understand, to feel all of this at the same time.

Almost the exact middle, actually. Young and school-trained London singer Woon's debut album, Mirrorwriting, sits between Katy B and James B, pop theatricality and singer-songwriter calm, club culture and bedroom indie, old-school soul and modern electronic R&B, extroverted and introverted. And tying it all together is the language of UK bass. His first major single, 2010's justly lauded "Night Air", announced him as one of a number of young English artists for whom garage, and everything that came after, was just another bit of pop language to use. And from the slow-motion jungle syncopations and muted bass blare of "Street" to the stuttering retro-rave breakbeats that drive "Spirits", the computer-assisted Woon makes sorta-pop from the last 20 years of UK dance the way current U.S. guitar kids draw from surf-rock and girl-groups.

It is relatively obvious that certain international business pursuits are more likely to influence environmental conditions. These types of businesses need to be especially concerned about the fashion in which they conduct business. They must assure citizens that the environment will not be tarnished for decades to come. I have no qualms about them facilitating business in an international setting, but they need to make sure that the environment doesn't become degraded as a result of their organizational operations.

We all know our mistakes and we're well aware of all the obvious ways we mess up and keep messing up. It's also one of the many reasons, we avoid God. Too many people think of God as the Judge of the Universe and feel unworthy to pray, step foot in a church, and hate the feeling of condemnation they feel when comparing themselves to what they ought to be doing.

Schirmbeck on Wednesday filed a formal complaint over the matter with Galveston County District Attorney Jack Roady. He also asked for an investigation into whether the city's use of public funds on pro-camera advertising on the public access television channel 16 and on the city's website violates state election law. In November, residents will have a chance to vote on whether to continue the photo ticketing program. Schirmbeck believes the slick video material was produced by Redflex, but the commercials did not disclose their true origin, in violation of state campaign laws.

When they were little, Walt Disney would take his two young daughters, Diane and Sharon, to play at the carousel at Griffith Park in Los Angeles every Sunday. While his daughters enjoyed their repeated rides, Disney sat on park benches with the other parents who had nothing to do but watch. It was on these Sunday excursions that Walt Disney began to dream of an activity park that had things for both children and parents to do.
During the evenings the crickets and cicadas sing. Combined with roosters, hens, ducks, wild birds, yowling skinny cats and the nightly chorus sent up by the campus's dog population this can all add up to quite the racket at bed time. Speaking of ducks, on my walk home from the office yesterday a tiny yellow duckling waddled across the open-air hallway I was threading my way through, looking lost yet determined. I hope he's found his way to safety, it's a jungle out there.
Joe Lipa brought two of my favorite beers of the entire festival. The first was Orval Trappist Ale which poured a hazy light amber color with floral, citrus and spice aromas. Nice tart flavors with a surprisingly full bodied mouthfeel. There was a slight hop bite with cider-like flavors. Very complex and interesting. The next was Lindemans Gueuze Cuvée René. This beer poured a golden color with very gentle aromas of fruit. The flavors were tart and refreshing with hints of yeast and cellar-like flavors. This was a very simple beer with quite a bit of depth.

We wear the babies on our bodies in Bjorns, Moby's, or slings, as we did with A. She is a tiny three-year-old, so a month ago, I asked her if she wanted to ride in the Ergo carrier on my back, since she was feeling jealous that O-Bear was in the Bjorn, next to me. She climbed in and I wore her on my back while I made cookies. She laid her sweet blonde head onto my back and said, "Ahhh. Isn't it nice to be stuck together like glue again, Mommy?" MELT.
While the first narrative was about people who had a multitude of reasons to not be happy, the second one could've almost been a fairytale. Here we meet Antoine (Kevin Parent) a middle-aged DJ who is living an enviable life raising two gorgeous daughters with his equally pretty girlfriend (Evelyne Brochu). But life is not always a bed of roses because he still thinks of his ex-wife (Hélène Florent), his first love and original soul mate.

The point here is surely not to deride empiricism. Heaven knows conservatism could stand to quit leading with its heart and start thinking more empirically about the world as it is, not the world as they wish it to be. The point, if I'm reading them correctly, is that too many leading voices on the left give themselves over to wonkiness, and presume that their moral convictions are widely shared, such that the only reason anybody could disagree with them is through ignorance (willful or not), or malice.

Perhaps it's no surprise then that the Mirror Pool has suddenly become my favourite place in the city. It's a sign of all that God's promised for Bradford is, in fact, coming. The wells of the Spirit are, in fact, now open. The curse IS lifted and Bradford IS free, she just doesn't realise it and so lives as if it isn't. But 'there is a time coming, and is now here', when Bradford will begin to realise that she IS loved by this Father who gave everything for her, even Jesus, and gives His Spirit without measure, and that she DOES have a future. This city is NOT what the media and some of her people paint her to be.
So when Atlanta's premier Master of the Dead calls to ask for help with a vampire on the loose, Kate leaps at the chance of some paying work.

Reaching goals requires motivation. ZenHabits does a nice job of explaining motivation, as well as ways to achieve it and sustain it during times of struggle. To find out more about motivation, check out the self-motivation quiz from Mindtools. After the quiz, there is a nice explanation of factors involved in self-motivation including: self-confidence and efficacy, positive thinking, focus, and environment. The author from the article How Self-Motivated Are You noted, "Self-motivation doesn't come naturally to everyone. And even those who are highly self-motivated need some extra help every now and then. Build your self-motivation by practicing goal-setting skills, and combining those with positive thinking, the creation of powerful visions of success, and the building of high levels of self-efficacy and self-confidence."
You were given to me by my second oldest sister back in the days when I was not such a food nerd. I bet you were just a $15-$20 product, but I felt like I was on the road to cooking awesome food when I unwrapped your box. (It was Christmas, I think.) You only had a two year warranty, and, to be honest, I didn't think you'd last past it.
But now let's get back to the fish at the top of this post. I didn't really make any resolutions per se this year, but I did decide I should try to cook and eat more fish. So good for you! So tasty! So many different fish to try!

In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the apple cider vinegar, balsamic vinegar, maple syrup, ketchup, red onion, garlic and chile. Stir and let simmer, uncovered, for about an hour. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook for 15 more minutes until the sauce thickens. Stir it often. If it seems too thick, add some water.

I really wanted to give the quilter the ability to use their stash but also allow them to go shopping. Who wouldn't want to have some of the newest cutest fabrics in their scrap quilt? It was VERY HARD for me to STOP buying fabric. I kept telling myself, "Ooooh! Wouldn't this be cute? I have to have a bit of this!" I actually used over 150+ fabrics in this quilt. I hope you have fun playing with your stash and adding the newest cutest fabrics to your quilt.

This Spring Break, I was fortunate enough to have my Hubby home from work for the whole week. Having this luxury gave our family the chance to spend more time together and take several trips in the local area. One of the places we chose was Jockey Hollow in Morristown, NJ. A historical place that housed the troops of George Washington from 1779 to 1780. It is a vast area, full of trails, soldier hut replicas, knotty trees, brush and many other interesting things. There is something so very peaceful about the woods.even with a bunch of kids running around. I just love to get re-energized walking through it. There is something so special to me, being in the woods. (Just don't ask me to sleep there overnight.)
Don't be offended if you post a comment and it doesn't show up for a few
Our first destination, although we didn't stop was a place called Macapa which is on the northern side of the Amazon where we picked up our pilot to show us the way down the river to Santarem. Didn't see the pilot but this river is so convoluted with masses of islands and tributaries, you would get hopelessly lost, not to say run aground. They put up a special map of the river where our charts are and there are several rivers at the mouth which go on for miles and miles. Because of these islands, we passed very close to the shoreline which was littered with driftwood. The trees rose straight from the water's edge and there were big reeds and grasses. Passing us, in the river were big clumps of green, various vegetation just drifting past with brown logs bobbing up and down. Thought they were crocodiles at first. Macapa, right on the equator looks like quite a large town, houses, tall buildings and some masts showing. Little huts down at the water's edge, but didn't see many people around apart from a few who were fishing in narrow boats. A tug boat called Titan was pulling two huge rafts piled high with sand and it was hot and humid out on deck.
How does this event foreshadow the ministry of the Levites? (As we will see later, the Levites will be chosen of all the tribes of Israel to attend to the Tabernacle and the religious service. "Then Moses said, 'You have been set apart to the Lord today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day." (Exodus 32:29 NIV))

Funny business this children-thing. My only (somewhat incoherent) conclusion is that you must do what you must do and get on with it the very best you can.
So, adoptive families must be more exact with their questions, since many of them probably would argue that baby-buying is corruption. Instead of asking, "Do you feel there is wide-spread corruption in China's program?" a better question might be "Do you feel that paying substantial amounts of money for children is adoption corruption? And how wide-spread do you feel this baby-buying is?" It may be that he hedges, like the villager in the opening story, out of a reluctance to air China's dirty laundry, for there is one characteristic of the Chinese that I understand very well, having lived with one for seven years: The Chinese do not like to reveal the dirty secrets of their country, even to friends. It is a tradition and understanding that goes back hundreds of years. We might view it as lying, but the Chinese consider it "saving face."

I believe that the US and its allies don't really give a tinker's curse about Afghanistan; as far as they are concerned, if the Afghans are intent on living in a barbaric medieval theocracy, where women are treated as chattels, those who don't share the faith of the rulers live in fear of death, and there're more or less continual low-level wars between various tribes, then they're welcome to do so. Admittedly, there is the poppy problem - Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of non-pharmaceutical grade opiates (92% in 2007) and also, incidentally, the world's largest producer of hashish - but, despite all the hype about the so-called War on Drugs, I have a feeling that (for all sorts of reasons, many sordid, which I won't go into here) the US and most other countries can live with that. No, the real problems are the two 500 pound

I have read through the Internet and came out with some conclusions. Firstly, all films are manipulative on some level but the way they handle it is how you distinguish whether they are subtle or heavy-handed. Now these two words are pretty ambiguous and they are rather the absolute so I think it is safe to say that no film is fully subtle or no film is fully heavy-handed. In fact, a lot of films, good or bad, is a mix and mash of both and it can be quite indiscernible most of the time. There are, however, films and cartoons that lean heavily towards each spectrum and I will try to give some examples below.
This book presents and discusses the economic and trade relations between the United States, Canada and Mexico. Topics discussed include Canada-U.S. relations; the United States-Canada trade and economic relationship; NAFTA and the future of commercial trucking across the Mexican border and the Cuban migration to the United States.

Now, this might sound all pretty straightforward, but Mieville's innovation is the locale. Beszel and Ul Qoma aren't neighboring cities like East and West Berlin, or Buda and Pest. Their streets and buildings literally co-occupy the same space. This creates an environment in which citizens of one city are required to "unsee" and "unhear" the citizens of the other, even though they might be walking down the same street or sitting on the same park bench. Monitoring everyone from both cities is the (almost) all-seeing secret police, Breach, which ruthlessly "disappears" offenders that break the rules of separation.
In a town where the economy has largely collapsed, the project of connecting local small food-producers with consumers in nearby cities is motivated more by the possibility of job creation than it is by pursuit of culinary nirvana.

That's it. There aren't really any short cuts. People always want short cuts. New acts often want to know how to get an agent. The chances are that any act asking how to get an agent doesn't really need an agent. And when they're at a stage where an agent can help them, they'll find there are agents there offering to help. That's how it works.

What a lie it is to believe that today is just going to be like every other day. It can't be with Jesus in it. His "love and life and grace and truth" are going to fill up today making sure that no "today" will be "just like yesterday." I wonder what we miss because we've stopped believing that Jesus will continue to leave us in awe and wonder, even on "just another Monday?"
The fact that it's almost Cinco de Mayo got me thinking about, well, of all things, Cinco de Mayo. In high school I lived about two hours north of the Mexican border in West Covina, California. Being a suburb of L.A., there were a number of easy access attractions available to young people including Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm (amazing pies and fried chicken), the famed Southern California beaches where I spent most of my summers, the San Diego Zoo and Tijuana, or T.J. as we referred to it.
TMT, developed over 20 years ago by social psychologists, explains how humans come to cope with death anxiety by developing self-esteem and attributing purpose to life. However, we do this by shoring up our own cultural identities, self-esteem, and frankly become more conservative in the way that we view others who might threaten our world view. So while Dark Tourism might make us feel all the better about being alive, it may make us less tolerant of others which just seems so counter-intuitive.

When I arrived in Cookeville, TN, an 18-year-old college freshman with no friends in a town far from home, I didn't know a whole lot. I was not a student of God's Word, and rarely contemplated matters of faith. I had no more than a vague idea about what I would do with my life. All I knew was that I loved music, and church seemed like a good place to meet friends.
It is nearly impossible to engender the necessary confidence, trust and loyalty a leader must possess without being fully engaged. A leader spends as much time out of the confines of the office engaging in real conversation with people as they do in their office planning, decision-making and organizing. Whether in person, over the phone, via email, through the social web, or even by sending a good old fashion "thank you" note - be an engaging conversationalist.

Did you know that in the world today there are 143 million orphans? They have no family to claim them and no parents to call their own. Many of them age out of the orphanages and become homeless, turning to drugs, suicide, or prostitution. Yet they are not without hope! The Lord cares for the orphans and following God's call in our life, we desire to give them a home, love, and a family to call their own. Please join us in praying for the orphans around the world that they would have enough food to eat, for someone to care for them, and for their protection. Please also pray that God would care for and provide for them until their adopting families can come get them. Pray that God would give us wisdom, discernment, and insight as we raise our adopted children.

In other Spring-related news the clocks are going forward on Saturday, so I will be losing an hour's worth of sleep (boo!). This means darker mornings for a bit, but lighter evenings. One of my favourite things about living in the Northern Hemisphere is that, in summer, it stays light until 10:00pm at night. I love how you can leave work at 17:30 and still feel like you have a substantial evening ahead of you. I will also no longer have to run in the dark, hunkering close to the H37 bus route and sprinting passed dark alleyways and spooky driveways ... it's the small things in life.

Then finally, they put me on depakote. I am mentioning this drug by name because I have heard from several other women that they believe depakote was the cause of this for them too, and a doctor at a California University said that he strongly, strongly believes that it gives PCOS to young women. Then I heard that some doctors have been instructed not to prescribe it to women under 40. Depakote won't own up to that and they knowingly let the doctors prescribe it (at least, until recently from what I hear). I don't want to get into who my sources are because I don't want to get anyone in trouble. It's very good for seizures, my brother had to take it for years and it kept him alive, but for Bipolar- not so much.

The day of the big dance, the twins are instructed to clean their rooms and while doing so, Elizabeth discovers George's letter to Enid. Using her mad Jessica Fletcher skillz, she finally deducts that it was her unhinged sister that told Ronnie about George. Of course, instead of confronting her like a normal person, Elizabeth begins to plot her revenge. Seeing as the last book established her unique brand of crap vengeance, she's probably just planning to hide Jessica's hairbrush or something.
If there was an award for courage in the cricketing world, it should very well be named after Bob Willis. When he was 26, he had operations on both his knees, which meant he was in constant pain whenever he played. In fact, on certain days, he needed to run five miles in order to generate the strength to play. It was only through his will that Willis managed to play and succeed at the top level for nine more years. At 6 feet 6 inches, Willis was an intimidating fast bowler, one of the fastest England have ever produced. His pace, bounce, aggression and swing made him deadly on all kinds of pitches across the world.

Or at least that's what happens to me when I am reminded of a song I like-the lyrics and music dance in my brain for hours at a time before fading away, often to appear again when I am trying to fall asleep in the middle of the night. Curses! My brother calls this phenomena 'ear worms'.an image I actually don't even like to think about!
This year tested that faith. There is no way around it: This was a lousy year in sports. Scandal. Disgrace. Crime. The horror in and around sports rose to previously unimagined depths -- the empire struck back, the dark side reigned.

Fan favorites left town. Legends went on trial. Concussions. Perjury. PEDs.

Liverworts, like mosses contain no vascular systems to transport water and nutrients throughout the plant. This means they are most likely to be found in damp shady locations.

The biggest emotion, though, is probably regret. Even though I was at the hospital several different times the week before he died, I never found the courage to really talk to him, to tell him that I forgave him for all the bad stuff. For the most part, I put all that behind me a long time ago, and focused on remembering the good times, the memories that can still make me smile. And that man is the one I miss, the man I wish was still here for Amy, to walk her down the aisle, to spoil our grandchildren, to sing to them.....
Hmm where do I start from? where? where? where.? Oh yeah, there!. So I'm quite certain that every believer knows what "New Creation" means (at least I hope so). When asked to define the term, words like "born-again", "salvation", "repentance", "baptism" etc are bound to be used in the definition. That's all good but who really is the "NEW CREATURE"? The creation story helped me understand this better so let's start from there. Once upon a time, God created man (and woman), gave him authority over everything on earth (Genesis 1:27-31) and placed him in the Garden of Eden where man could be close to HIM (GOD) all the time. One day, the enemy of God (and all God's children), satan, tricked man into sinning against God. Satan gave man "sin and the pleasures that come with it" and in return man gave up his authority over earth and everything in it, hence, man came under the rulership of satan. Uhmm.. yeah I guess you can call it an exchange. satan brought sin to man and man paid with his authority over the earth. A poor exchange indeed.but hey, it was no robbery. Anyway, satan, having all the authority now, become the ruler of man; and man the slave of satan (Jesus replied, "Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin" John 8:32). Man was forever doomed as a slave of the enemy and like anyone who is sentenced to life imprisonment without appeal, the only way of escape is DEATH. Scary huh? I know! Well, God who created man and loved man in spite of man's disobedience wanted to free His creation from bondage so He had to send no one else but LIFE to set man free. The Son of God, JESUS CHRIST is LIFE (Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the LIFE.John 14:6; "In him was LIFE.John 1:4). JESUS was/is the only ONE who can set man free.WHY? Think of it this way. Man's only hope of escaping the slavery of satan is death and we all know everyone dies but once. You have one chance to live and after that, there is death and judgement etc. God couldn't watch man die in his sins so there had to be another way to set man free and that way is JESUS. Jesus came on the earth as a man, suffered and died.but uh huh, that's the best part. He died not just for dying sake but He died so He could defeat DEATH. He had to defeat death so He could give man a second chance to life. For 3 days He was dead but on the 3rd day, He rose again having won POWER over death."..Whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have EVERLASTING life" John 3:16. Everlasting life is possible in Jesus because He holds both the power of LIFE (because He is LIFE) and DEATH(because He defeated death) in His hands. Any man who then believes in Him is set free from slavery through death but is given another chance to live and is given a NEW LIFE. Jesus creates the old slave who died anew and breathes LIFE again into his nostrils to make him a living soul.(Then the LORD God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being: Genesis 2:7). This is why anyone who is born-again/born in Christ is said to be a NEW CREATURE (Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new: 2 Corinthians 5:17). Just like the first man ever created, the NEW CREATURE is not placed back on in the world he just got freed from, he is placed into a world, a place, a kingdom where he can be close to God again. The NEW CREATURE no longer belongs to the world of sin and slavery (.because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you- John 15:19). The blessings and authority (Gen. 1:28-31) man God first gave to man before the fall is returned to the NEW CREATURE who becomes part of the body of Christ (.and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all- Ephe. 1:20-23). Yup! Not only does the NEW YOU receive freedom and salvation in CHRIST, but you also receive power and authority over satan and his followers. So now you know.The "NEW YOU" who is born in CHRIST is more powerful and more important than can be comprehended. YOU are God's own precious POSSESSION bought at a very high price. YOU are PRICELESS as could be. Turn to HIS WORD to fully know the "NEW YOU" He created.

As we approached Shoreditch, I spotted this building. I couldn't see a date on it but it looks Victorian. A deliciously extravagant design, this pub was once called Ye Olde Axe but the name has been painted over and the swinging sign has all but lost its paintwork. The building looks neglected and in need of repair, like something out of a Gothic horror film. An illuminated sign on the side reads "Striptease". Unsurprisingly, the clock no longer works. It is very sad to see buildings like this being allowed to fall into a state of neglected disrepair.
Honeybees, like ants and termites, are considered super-organisms. This means that although the colony is made up of many individuals, none of the individuals can survive without the comradery of one another. The queen, workers and drones each have their job, and each job is essential for the survival of the colony. The swarm of bees occurs for many reasons, not enough space is the most common reason, and when it does happen, it is the equivalent of a colony of bees giving birth to another colony. Leaving the hive in this swarm is the mother of the bees from the initial hive, some her loyal workers, and some drones in a massive, incredible, engagingly powerful performance. They leave the 'parent hive' looking for new nesting grounds, and in the parent hive they just left, grows a new queen, hatching out young sister bees eager to usher her in to the culture of the hive and ensure her safety in her mating flight and new role as new mother of the colony. All of this is done through the true interdependence, constant plebiscites, and instantaneous communication of the colony.. lol.. much like our society works right? Well, in a community with the Hive Mentality it does!
And so I began. I used the instructions I found online as my chief guide but after three days I was a little skeptical that the sour dough had fermented enough or produced enough yeast. My Twitter friend Finn said that he had been feeding his starter ("Veruca") for 12 days and it was now time. So I asked him if he thought my starter was ready? He confirmed what I thought and said no. So I've been letting "Finn Jr". grow and grow.

Well, we never made that myrtle. The problem wasn't the hogs busting us. It was the coyote. One old mangy dog was loitering around the herd. These pigs were big enough not to be bothered by a pesky song dog, but they certainly took notice of him after he caught wind of our activities and bounded away. The coup de grace, though, were the turkeys. A couple hens were holding sentry and naturally took off when they saw us, taking the finally-frightened hogs with them. Wild pigs don't have the best sense of sight, but they're wary enough to recognize something amiss. (And how strange is it to find a coyote, hogs, and turkeys hanging around each other outside of a Disney movie?)

We join together in meditation and prayer this morning seeking to realize that the fabric of our lives is woven by our own hands, every thought, every word, every action is a thread in the social tapestry. So as we weave let us always be mindful that each and every thread is a contribution, our contribution, to the whole. Amen.
Then I noticed, the refrigerator is on the fritz, yet again. It's turned up to nine and just barely keeping things cool. The repair man kept saying he was coming. Until the manager called him again at 6pm and he said, tomorrow. The manager said, and in the meantime their food is going bad.
On our way to the beach, we stopped in Thomasville to visit with Aaron's brother, Mark, and his family. We love staying with them, and they are always so willing to let us crash.

We've done a load of work at the White Horse previously (see Rounds 1, 2, 3, 4) but we were asked back to go over a wall that we've done previously (that was looking a little grubby due to the addition of some low-grade graffiti), freshen up the gents toilet door, take care of a tall wall beside the bar and also throw in a few little extras scattered around the place. The White Horse is one of our favourite local boozers so working there is always good fun and design-wise we've obviously run with the whole White Horse identity but given it a little id-iom twist.

I followed my parent's home, even though they weren't aware of my presense. My mom wept all the way while my dad remained silent. He begged my mom to calm down but it all fell on deaf ears. We got home to find the house filled with friends and relatives, my Dad carried my body and laid it on the mat in the living room. Prayers for forgiveness were said, and my parents were advised to stop crying as it wouldn't bring me back. I watched my Mom cry and weep all night as she asked God why He Had to take my life.
It took all morning but we finally convinced Tali that she was two. She kept saying, "No!" but that her response to everything these days. ;) She didn't want to blow out the candles because she just wanted to dig into the cherry tomatoes. Those were the favorites and the first to disappear. Tali also ate the apples and sampled the cucumbers. Ana ate tomatoes, oranges, apples, cucumbers, and celery. She sampled the peppers. Amanda ate everything after arranging it all neatly on her plate. We didn't get to the pineapple so we'll try that at snack time.
I remember spending countless hours in college listening to experts give their spiel on how to be as successful as them. And, I even remember the names of a few of the more memorable ones and, if I look deep enough, I still have a few of their business cards.

Here's the Great Audrey. The pageant tiara or more commonly known Holly Golightly pictured below, is the tiara we associate with brides today. She was somehow regal, whether faking it till she made it in Breakfast at Tiffany's, or the European aristocrat in Roman Holiday. Note how Audrey could wear these three very different tiaras in the roles she played.

If I didn't know any better i'd be an alcoholic by now, good thing i'm smarter than that. "And the worlds got me dizzy again, you'd think after 24 years i'd be used to the spin." man this line by Conor is so damn true.

Sitting with a pint of larger and a gaggle of friends (maybe a boyfriend). Feeling a moral victory as City were not ,all, about money. The great fan loyalty that saw season ticket sales rise when we were relegated. Living with a boyfriend on the street next to the ground, watching the people streaming past the house, the streets filled with cheers. Catching sight of players in bars, a drink with a football player.
A pretty shamrock! At this point you just tie it off and you are done. You could attach this to a hairpin or headband if you want. I decided to make it into a ring.
Emily Cale spent the majority of her childhood as a visitor to the worlds of her favorite authors. With encouragement from her English teachers, she put pen to paper and began imagining her own stories. Preferring the fascinating lives of her characters, she majored in creative writing. When not lost in a manuscript or a good book, she enjoys crocheting, rock climbing, and playing board games. She currently lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with her husband and a very spoiled cat.
When I was in Phnom Penh recently, I discovered in the guidebook that there was a cafe called the "Lazy Gecko Cafe". I looked it up on the map and saw that it was quite far from where I was staying and also from most of the areas I would be visiting. However, the pull to seek out this lazy gecko was strong and on my final day, I decided to hunt it down and sink a coffee or two.

And that was my first experience with alcohol. I definitely understand what it means now to "take the edge off" and it was actually quite delightful.
All edges were coloured with Memento green dye ink applied with cut'n'dry foam. The bottom panels were first trimmed out of Kraft card and then matted with the pink paper.and stuck in place as shown. The main panel on the plaque was put together similarly but before attaching was stamped with a moth stamp (PaperArtsy) in Archival black ink and embellished with a diecut (Nestabilities) tag with pink panel and another 'Smile' stamp (PaperArtsy). The roses were applied at the base on foam pads. A piece of 3 mm dark green satin ribbon was tied through the hole in the tag and a piece of black numbers Washi tape applied before sticking in place.
Repair & Maintenance
Ann, or perhaps Jo, said that one impressive thing about the novel was the way that early on we are led to see the Garners as unusually philanthropic slave owners, but later realize that this is just a matter of relativity, and that they have their own cruelties. I said that one of the most horrifying moments for me, though, was not the out-and-out cruelty from which it's easy to distance oneself, but the incident towards the end when Sethe's living daughter Denver goes to the abolitionists' house to ask for work. Here she comes across something which horrifies her: a small statue of a black child with its head pulled back and its lower lip extended to receive coins casually thrown down, ready for paying tradesmen - a figure so like the Little-Black-Sambo collection figures that stood unremarked outside shops and in arcades in my own childhood, that I was pushed up suddenly against my own unconscious collusion in racism.

I still believe in the standard of care that most midwives provide for low-risk, uncomplicated pregnancies and births. I do believe that when I started bleeding at 15 weeks, the midwife should have bowed out of my care. I do believe that when I was sure my water broke at 18 weeks, she should have bowed out of my care. I don't blame midwives in general. I'm not even sure I blame her specifically. I should have spoken up. I should have insisted on an ultrasound. I should have asked for a second opinion. I didn't. At the least, we share blame. At the most, as his mother, the blame falls on me for not protecting him.
I've been speculating about the issue because I had to write an English essay for the first time in well over thirty years and my God, were my sentences mangled. Everything I've learned through writing fiction was forgotten in an instant and I was once more an intense, swotty teenager, constructing sentences of labyrinthine complexity, laying sub-clause on sub-clause, periphrasis on qualification, until the whole inelegant edifice collapsed under its own weight.
For this also there is no technological or large-scale solution. Perhaps, as they believe, the most conscientiously up-to-date people can easily do without local workshops and stores, local journalism, a local newspaper, a local post office, all of which supposedly have been replaced by technologies. But what technology can replace personal privacy or the coherence of a family or a community? What technology can undo the collateral damages of an inhuman rate of technological change?
Sort of the flip side of the last post when I was wondering what we should commit ourselves to crafting as a group. What do you think you is worth some money in the Station Cash Store? What should we consider buying?
A closer look at the jewellery rack shows the Swarovski rack, pearl rack, gemstone rack, some still to be bagged and sorted stones, Scrabble tiles for pendants, many MANY pairs of pliers and cutters, the world's largest collection of steel wool, hundreds of dollars worth of sterling silver wire, and a train case FULL of unset stones for ring making!
Lately I've been digging the Los Gatos Creek Trail for my long runs. Even though you are still in the middle of a heavily populated area, parts of the trail make you feel like you are in the middle of nowhere.
The next morning we made the short trip from Bela Vista, the small village on the Paraguayan border where we had stayed the previous night, to Fazenda Marilandia. This ranch is owned by Renata Stephen's (our tour guide) aunt, Maria Loureiro Pinheiro, and is managed by her son, (Renata's first cousin) Sergio Loureiro Pinheiro. The head cowboy, Roberto, was also available to show us around. He has been employed by Fazenda Marilandia for 35 years.
The sheer random chance of such an encounter was part of the danger inherent in the setting. On the other hand, you could encounter a group of giant rats or one cave bear by itself. There needs to be more random elements to things while providing players, in the option of the stone giants, with the opportunity to retreat if and when needed.

Jolly Holiday's- Tree 1
Having just been exposed to tombs, mummies and the world of Hatshepsut full-throttle in a middle school text book, it seemed more fitting than ever to face the crowds and potential chaos with three kids ages 6 - 11, all in the name of seeing the real thing. And, with no more strollers or diapers to consider, it was well worth the attempt.

In 1968, the 140 year old London Bridge had started to sink into the Thames. Instead of trying to rescue it, the Corporation of London sold it for US$2.5m. American entrepreneur Robert P McCulloch had the bridge dismantled and sent by barge to California, where it was rebuilt at Lake Havasu. Near the bridge is an "English Village" which pays homage to our culture, while here our authorities are destroying it. It has Tudor-style architecture, and the shops and restaurants create the atmosphere of 'Olde England', with tree-lined walkways and local breweries for hand-brewed ale.
So, adoptive families must be more exact with their questions, since many of them probably would argue that baby-buying is corruption. Instead of asking, "Do you feel there is wide-spread corruption in China's program?" a better question might be "Do you feel that paying substantial amounts of money for children is adoption corruption? And how wide-spread do you feel this baby-buying is?" It may be that he hedges, like the villager in the opening story, out of a reluctance to air China's dirty laundry, for there is one characteristic of the Chinese that I understand very well, having lived with one for seven years: The Chinese do not like to reveal the dirty secrets of their country, even to friends. It is a tradition and understanding that goes back hundreds of years. We might view it as lying, but the Chinese consider it "saving face."

SkyWest's total operating revenues increased $55.2 million, or 6.4%, during the quarter ended March 31, 2012, over the same period in 2011. The increase in operating revenues was the result of higher pass-through costs (primarily fuel and engine overhaul costs) under SkyWest's agreements with its major partners and an increase in block hour production. The increase in operating revenues was offset by a planned reduction in prorate flying block hours of 13.4% resulting in reduced revenues of approximately $6.0 million. In spite of the reducing operating revenues from prorate flying, SkyWest's revenue per available seat mile for this flying increased 14.6% from improved pricing. After excluding the increased pass-through costs of approximately $31.1 million, for fuel and engine overhauls, and the reduction in prorate flying revenue of $6.0, total operating revenues increased approximately $30.1 million due to the additional block hour production of 3.1% and improved utilization. Total block hours for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 were 556,421 compared to 539,910 for the same period last year.
But ending her relationship with the bikini company did not make Farrow any less dangerous. Her near-nakedness remained on display in places like Penthouse Magazine, FHM Magazine, and numerous other places who trade on the twisted ways of immodest women and play with the safety of the world on a regular basis. And as the years went by, Farrow started adding more tattoos to her body, making her not only an immodest women, but an immodest women who violated divine commandments by marking her body! There can be little question that she can be held responsible for the 2008 Sichuan earthquake that killed over 68,000 people in China.
These rooms could be GREAT!

Anyway, I haven't been able to visit the lovely blogs on blogosphere and telling the oh-so-many talented bloggers out there how much I love their recipes and posts. I am sorry. I truly am.

I know its the rudest thing possible, but please know each and every comment you leave makes my day.

Even though it's not the end, it's fitting that today's Friday Update deals exclusively with ends. More specifically, savage backsides; superior posteriors made extra savage through hard, heavy training. And today of all days is an explosion of gluteal savagery, booty awesomeness, and asses that just plain go POW. Huge thanks to all the contributors, such as Lift Big Eat Big, and all you savage, savage ladies who helped make today a Callipygian Cornucopia.
Her performance is much more entertaining than that of her granddaughter Katie Waissel on The X Factor. Perhaps Simon Cowell might care to comment.
The aroma was filled with the recognizable smell of Smith and Cross: strong, funky and full of promise. Of course the molasses was there as well, though I am still not sure if I was smelling the actual molasses or the Smith and Cross. Also, the pineapple spear, which was an utter garnish failure, awkward protuberance that it was, added a bit of undefinable fruitiness to the nose. The first sip was very molasses-y, though the hogo of the rum carried through at the end. You would think that there would be some sweetness in this drink, but it was dry and earthy, with a vague powdery texture that made each sip seem almost chewy. After I increased the bitters, the spices became more detectable on the swallow. The flavors of the molasses were also enhanced by the increase in bitters--the drink seemed sweeter, in that pleasing molasses cookie way, and the flavors in general seemed more balanced. Overall, not bad but not great.
Every time the subject of marriage comes up, I have to shake my head at the single girls I know. Some of them are younger than I am, some of them are my age, some older. They all want that holy grail of dating and relationships - a husband. It's like some crowning achievement. An end game. Life would only be complete if I had a husband.
The Kingdom of God starts small, a grain of wheat, a mustard seed, a leaven in the loaf. And it spreads, oh, yes, it grows. But it starts small, even hidden in the secret places, a knitting together of wonder, perhaps. A candle on a lamp stand, a woman searching for a coin, a man in a field with a treasure worth selling everything to possess.
And Van and Logan just sort of walk out the room when the topic comes up.

I finally switched on my computer (largely because I had an e-mail from a French friend that asked why there were no results) and found the HuffPo summary immediately. No surprises. Labour making gains at the government's expense - it was expected and is not unusual for local elections around half-way through a government's life. Under the Thatcher government this used to happen quite often yet the lady went on to lead her party to victory several times.

The day of the big dance, the twins are instructed to clean their rooms and while doing so, Elizabeth discovers George's letter to Enid. Using her mad Jessica Fletcher skillz, she finally deducts that it was her unhinged sister that told Ronnie about George. Of course, instead of confronting her like a normal person, Elizabeth begins to plot her revenge. Seeing as the last book established her unique brand of crap vengeance, she's probably just planning to hide Jessica's hairbrush or something.
Well, personally, I tend to spy a certain vulgarity when such impossibly subjective matters are stated like facts in this way (though I blame neither the brewery nor the organisers of this event for feeling the need to enter into the spirit of a good old public relations exercise every once in a while). I do also wonder whether an ale of such bloodcurdling power really ought to be hailed in this way on a global scale - looking at it from moral/public health perspective.
When I was young, my aunt and uncle would take me "antiquing" with them and we would find an assortment of treasures along the way. I loved finding something cool that had been discarded. I'm a firm believe in "one man's trash is another man's treasure." Recently, a friend borrowed our trailer to remove some old junk from his basement. I had the opportunity to do a little digging through his "trash" on the hunt for some treasures. Of course, I had this challenge in mind and I was so hoping to find something I could use. I was not to be disappointed! In fact, you'll see a few more items I found over the course of this month.
In the short time I'd been out Nirab had recruited Stupid Peter into his God cult.

Here it is. The real purpose of the visit to Pho 68. Pho with rare beef and braised beef. It looked the part, and tasted it too. They've got the makings of a really good pho here. The stock was excellent. Deep, aromatic and intensely savoury. Wafer thin slices of beef were rare on arrival but cooked through as time progressed, the gentle poaching keeping them tender. The braised beef (brisket I think) was also sliced thin, but had a stronger, minerally flavour. The tendon running through it was soft and gelatinous speaking of long, slow cooking. The noodles, save for a little gluey clump at the top, were cooked just right.

For the stock: add all ingredients to a soup pot. Pick off all the chicken that you want to eat. Put everything else in the pot. Cook about 35 to 45 minutes. Remove chicken bones, skin, etc. from pot. Remove and discard bay leaves and anything else. You should have approximately 3 quarts of stock. (Again, if you just buy chicken stock you can skip this whole apart)

First I placed a straight pin through the center of a red felt Pretty Posy, then I placed it through each section of the wheel as I bent it in. Then I used the pin to attach the pinwheel to the eraser of the pencil. I bent the pin down and taped it securely to the pencil so no fingers would get pricked.

Charming landscaping. Flanked by a community mosque on one side and the Karachi residence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi on the other, Hilal Park stretches over a hillock. The landscape design, which makes exceptional use of the topography, is the highlight of the Park. A brick path, edged with immaculately pruned topiaries weaves through well-maintained, exotically shaped flower beds, up a hill, and over culverts and wooden bridges that span over the narrow ravines in the rock formations.
I don't know if this piece has any kind of value today. Maybe the fact that the whole set is now dismantled, must decrease its value. And although such ensemble was (and still is) far from cheap, my mom paid only half of its retail value because she could get it directly from the factory where one of her friend worked back then.
A. I wrote my first picture books when I was three years old. Actually I drew the pictures and my mom helped me write the story. Then I wrote my first novel when I was in ninth grade. It took me all year, and it was pretty terrible. But when I finished, I wrote another book and another and another. During my senior year, after I'd finished a fantasy novel, I went to a writing conference and pitched an agent. But I was too sensitive and I didn't really know anything about the industry, and it didn't go well. I left the conference thinking that publishing wasn't for me. I knew I would always write, but I figured I wouldn't really pursue being published. I wrote consistently after that but never really showed my writing to anyone. Then a year and a half ago I started writing Unraveling and joined a writing group for fun. They really loved it and encouraged me to let an agent take a look.

Schirmbeck on Wednesday filed a formal complaint over the matter with Galveston County District Attorney Jack Roady. He also asked for an investigation into whether the city's use of public funds on pro-camera advertising on the public access television channel 16 and on the city's website violates state election law. In November, residents will have a chance to vote on whether to continue the photo ticketing program. Schirmbeck believes the slick video material was produced by Redflex, but the commercials did not disclose their true origin, in violation of state campaign laws.

In addition to this study-load I threw myself under a Roadlink Bus by opting to sign up for the Google AdWords Certification Program to increase my work capabilities (requires min 85% to pass).

JS - How badly prepared has the SPL been for this eventuality? Should it have foreseen this eventuality or is this something you think has emerged from, I mean, not too many people probably a number of years ago would have thought Rangers might be a club that would face potential administration and further potential liquidation. Has the SPL been well enough prepared for this eventuality?

With Britain looking increasingly likely to secure possession of Palestine, it paved the way for the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a letter addressed to Victor's uncle, Lionel Walter Rothschild, which promised that His Majesty's government would do their utmost to establish 'a national home for the Jewish people' in Palestine. It was a 'declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations', and ultimately led to the creation of Israel. Today Balfour Day is celebrated there on November 2nd.

I knew almost nothing about either, so it was a big adventure each week to go to the university's excellent music-school library and rummage through the record bins.
I don't know if this piece has any kind of value today. Maybe the fact that the whole set is now dismantled, must decrease its value. And although such ensemble was (and still is) far from cheap, my mom paid only half of its retail value because she could get it directly from the factory where one of her friend worked back then.
Friends, I have Cathy with me today and she is happy to respond to all of your beauty comments and questions, if any. Like all of us, she's a work in progress and open to improvement.
The point of cleavage between those who hold the crude theory of Baptismal regeneration, ex opere operato, and those who maintain what is usually spoken of as the "Hypothetical Theory," lies just here. The former believe that the recital of a formula and the performance of a particular action necessarily produce the spiritual effect of regeneration; the latter hold that where believing prayer is offered for a blessing, which we have reason to believe it is God's will to grant, that prayer will be provisionally answered. The former believe that this spiritual result is absolute, and admits of being neither reversed nor supplemented; the latter maintain that the result, whatever it is, must needs be provisional in its character, and cannot be made absolute until the condition upon which in the case of an adult it is contingent is complied with. The former maintain that the saving effect of this ordinance may be lost by wilful sin; the latter maintain that such saving effects only remain if the condition on which they are contingent is complied with, and, even where wilful sin does not occur, are forfeited by the non-fulfilment of the appointed condition. According to the former theory, no baptized member of our congregations needs to be born again, or, indeed, can be, although his life may be a discredit to our common humanity, and it would seem that the only hope for him lay in the possibility of so radical a change ; according to the other, all who have never consciously exercised faith in the special promise of God made in Baptism need to be told, "Ye must be born again." The difference between the two positions, which may seem to be slight, is really radical. The Gorham judgment given on appeal by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council affirmed that the hypothetical explanation of the formularies of the Church of England was a perfectly reasonable and legitimate one, though it did not affirm that it was the only possible interpretation. See GORHAM CASE.

I think I figured out the problem with porting the comments. Wordpress is trying to take the comments from Blogger but Disqus is in the way. So I'll shut down Disqus on this blog (all comments should still be there in Blogger format), leave this place with moderation on so I don't have to keep coming back to delete Captain Mindless the ASH Troll, and all new posts will be at the new place.

Thus, no doubt soon you will probly hear soon some business leaders or pretend potential self-appointed communist leaders lamenting the lack of organization of the #Occupy movements, describing them as "in choate" (which is a kind of wide penis with no head), or "udderless," or "lacking discernible goals" (like Sporting Gijon). What they are really mean is that there is a ferment of new ideas that therefore could be dangerous and must be curtailed, or at least curtopped. After all, nobody has any idea where a march that goes nowhere might end up. If these peoples weren't too feckless to emigrate we could at least lure them onto a ferry with the promise of jobs in Australia and transport them there. We would never hear of them ever again! But while they are there, in the midst of ordinary, heads-down, knees-back God-fearing punters, fermenting theories without limitations and trying out new processes, such as democracy-never a positive development-they constitute a threat to our docile, passive, obedient way of life. They must be stomped on by square-headed baton-wielding riot police, preferably from up the country, before any new ideas seep out into the public body at large, like a ball of ideological pus.
The Irish are famed worldwide for our stern drinking abilities, we are hailed and often times mocked for our capabilities to handle the odd drink or two, but is this something to be proud of? Homeland of the black stuff and more than likely a few alcoholics, Ireland is inevitably a land of excess. By no means am I preaching to give it up, just revise and be wise before you enter your latest boose filled night on the town. The Irish do love to drink but our famed party culture is no excuse to develop unhealthy drinking habits!

Funny I didn't need that book cause I was entertained the whole time I was in the air. You know you don't want to stare at the other passengers but you do. And you try and not think 'please don't sit by me" but you do. I scored with no babies next to me screaming (although there was an adorable screamer in front of me) . And the nice Scottish man in front of that baby.was so not impressed. The little one thought his head was a play toy. While he kept saying 'ma'am, ma'am' to get Moms attention.Mom and Dad kept slamming back beers and Vodka. We were on our way to Vegas!

Monday was so nice. I got up later than I had on the trip, but earlier than usual for me. I lazed around all day, catching up on tv shows that I had missed while I was gone, and catching up on a few things online. It was so nice to have air conditioning, electricity, my computer, my phone, and my bed. All things that I missed on the trip.

All edges were coloured with Memento green dye ink applied with cut'n'dry foam. The bottom panels were first trimmed out of Kraft card and then matted with the pink paper.and stuck in place as shown. The main panel on the plaque was put together similarly but before attaching was stamped with a moth stamp (PaperArtsy) in Archival black ink and embellished with a diecut (Nestabilities) tag with pink panel and another 'Smile' stamp (PaperArtsy). The roses were applied at the base on foam pads. A piece of 3 mm dark green satin ribbon was tied through the hole in the tag and a piece of black numbers Washi tape applied before sticking in place.

Yes and no. Ordinary sexuality dimly reflects the external appearance of this necklace; but in truth these women are the direct All-Attractive Energies (bhagavan-prakti), the divine goddesses, eternal manifestations of the fullness of the Absolute All-Attractive Being.
I really wanted to give the quilter the ability to use their stash but also allow them to go shopping. Who wouldn't want to have some of the newest cutest fabrics in their scrap quilt? It was VERY HARD for me to STOP buying fabric. I kept telling myself, "Ooooh! Wouldn't this be cute? I have to have a bit of this!" I actually used over 150+ fabrics in this quilt. I hope you have fun playing with your stash and adding the newest cutest fabrics to your quilt.
With Britain looking increasingly likely to secure possession of Palestine, it paved the way for the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a letter addressed to Victor's uncle, Lionel Walter Rothschild, which promised that His Majesty's government would do their utmost to establish 'a national home for the Jewish people' in Palestine. It was a 'declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations', and ultimately led to the creation of Israel. Today Balfour Day is celebrated there on November 2nd.

The weather's been beautiful this past week: blue skies, sunshine, rising temperatures. It's even been warm enough to eat lunch outside. It's really hard to believe that last year at this time, we still had a bit of snow. Of course, the cold can come back anytime, but for now, it's the most beautiful spring weather.

What are you learning from these grown unschoolers?That they are mostly all pleased with their education; that they continue to love learning; that they are not afraid of being different or weird, that they are as 'well rounded' as anyone else is, that they are passionate about what they do and that they continue to be self-directed in their lives.

First of all, for those who don't know I have 3 adopted siblings. They are all from the Philippines. Actually there are six kids in my family and our order goes a bit like this - biological, adopted, biological, adopted, biological, adopted. :) My parents were also foster parents for about 8 years, so we had infants in and out of our house - most in which (I think) were adopted. So as you can tell adoption has been a pretty big part of my life. I always knew I wanted to adopt. It just seemed like something I was suppose to do when having a family. My husband's family is a bit different from mine - he's the only one! Although we came from different types of families, we both knew we wanted to have a family eventually.

I was thinking, researching and analyzing a lot of information in past several months - particularly, how all those things happening in Thailand (political problems, social unrest) and in the world (economic crisis, "pandemic", rise of transnational corporate fascism), and perhaps fair to say in universe (I wouldn't got into much details about it here, would only say - all the metaphysical and spiritual sides of our existence and current events) - and how ALL that affects me personally. and mainly - what and how I should do about it.
Down on the bay shore, Henry Yesler had been operating his sawmill since about two years ago. He had shut the machine off for the day, for this was a day like no other. He would soon join a few others of his American associates, to sign a treaty with the natives whose ancient lands were all around. Chief Seattle would arrive to represent the Duwamish and Salish peoples; he was known among the new settlers as a reasonable man, a leader who understood the tectonics of this moment's history.

Watching my children and the aspirations that they have got me thinking. When do children stop aspiring to be heros? Ask any boy what he wants to be when he grows up and you're likely to be answered with things like firefighter, police officer, super hero, doctor. I've yet to meet a child who dreamed of being an accountant, lawyer, or sanitation engineer(though to be fair, my kids get really excited when the garbage truck comes rolling past our house). There is nothing wrong with any of the professions I've just mentioned, and I think they're all equally important. Perhaps we feel as we grow older that if we can't be super heros, then why bother trying? That, and being a super hero isn't a real job. A number of people are quite keen to pitch in around the community, or help someone on the side of the highway with a flat tire. We generally stop actively looking for people to help though.

Such determination in her work life goes hand in hand with sacrifices in her social life. She often finds herself declining invites to parties or social gatherings in favour of a few more hours sewing or attending a networking event. When this happens, Judith simply reminds herself "Well they are only drinking wine, I'm not really missing out on that much". This sort of perspective has helped her throughout her career.

It is nearly impossible to engender the necessary confidence, trust and loyalty a leader must possess without being fully engaged. A leader spends as much time out of the confines of the office engaging in real conversation with people as they do in their office planning, decision-making and organizing. Whether in person, over the phone, via email, through the social web, or even by sending a good old fashion "thank you" note - be an engaging conversationalist.

Drifting refers to a driving technique and to a motorsport where the driver intentionally over steers, causing loss of traction in the rear wheels through turns, while maintaining vehicle control and a high exit speed. A car is drifting when the rear slip angle is greater than the front slip angle prior to the corner apex, and the front wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or vice versa), and the driver is controlling these factors. As a motor sport, professional drifting competitions are held worldwide. Drift challenges drivers to navigate a course in a sustained sideslip by exploiting coupled nonlinearities in the tire force response.

At the wheel of Falken Tire's Porsche 911 GT3 RSR, the winning car at Mid-Ohio and Baltimore, Bryan Sellers (USA) posted the ninth quickest time. He contests the race with Porsche factory pilot Wolf Henzler (Germany). "We didn't have an optimal set-up today, but we know that our car and the tyres will perform much better in the race than in the qualifying," explained Bryan Sellers. Wolf Henzler added: "The circuit was very cold over the last days. Today we have sun and the asphalt temperatures were suddenly much higher. That changed everything. Our team still simply lacks the experience of reacting to such changes in a short timeframe."

My memoir on adopting my daughter from China was perhaps the hardest thing I ever wrote mainly because at the same time that I was trying to understand what was going on, what this sudden unexpected journey in the middle of my life actually meant, to capture in words what it actually felt like- I was trying to get others to understand, to feel all of this at the same time.
I used to sell property and casualty insurance down in Sarasota Florida. I remember after I got licensed I was supposed to find a target niche for my prospecting efforts and develop a marketing strategy to target businesses within that niche. I picked professional liability after some quick success in that line of business and put together a prospect list of companies who I wanted to approach about writing their insurance. There was one account that I set my eyes on and really wanted to land. It was a large multi location diagnostics facility with large property and casualty exposures that would not only result in a challenge to structure but would land me a huge commission if I could write the account.
That's it. There aren't really any short cuts. People always want short cuts. New acts often want to know how to get an agent. The chances are that any act asking how to get an agent doesn't really need an agent. And when they're at a stage where an agent can help them, they'll find there are agents there offering to help. That's how it works.
It all started well enough. I decided that instead of just sitting at the table eating green beans and rolls while everyone else told me how wonderful the turkey tasted, I'd go ahead and make myself a mock turkey out of tofu. I found a recipe, made a grocery list, and almost bought all of it.
Even though it was quite disappointing for we the children, the parents especially the mothers were happy because it spared them the trouble of waking up at dawn to cook the Ampesi, Banku, Konkonte, Mpotopoto, Tuo Zaafi (Ghanaian dishes). Did I hear you say, you sent the Fried Rice and Chicken, Potato chips and Chicken and burgers? Hmm, my dear friend, this was what I dreamt of sending to Our Day. Nevertheless, Our Day was still fun. There were lots of toffees, chocolate, biscuits, cookies, drinks and delicious food from the school's canteen. The one who made my Our Day always memorable was one of my favourite teachers, Mr. Quartey. He was my class 5 teacher. He loved to pamper me and my squad (P.I.A - don't ask for the meaning). It wasn't that we were teachers' pets but... aha we had favour from our teachers.

A review of' 3 Idiots says its makers borrowed only scraps from Chetan Bhagat's Five Point Someone. "Rajkumar Hirani and co-writer Abhijat Joshi churn out some delectable idiotgiri, laced with juvenile humour and tear-shedding moments," says the reviewer whose rating of the movie is 3.5 on a scale of 5. I would give the book 3 point something on a scale of 10.
The Kingdom of God starts small, a grain of wheat, a mustard seed, a leaven in the loaf. And it spreads, oh, yes, it grows. But it starts small, even hidden in the secret places, a knitting together of wonder, perhaps.

While we were at the dr's office I set The Bug up with a little notebook and some crayons but she was too curious to stay in the chair once Sweet Pea started screaming and squirming. She came over and stood next to me asking, "why are you crying, Sweet Pea?" and eventually, after nobody answered her and the screaming and struggling continued, she began to cry a little bit too, out of nervousness or worry or just plain empathy for her sister. The Bug is very easily pulled out of these things, though, by the offer of a lollypop from the nurse. She doesn't hold grudges. Sweet Pea remembers, though... she was like, "to hell with your lollypop, lady; Mom, get me the frack out of here NOW." I bought her a smoothie (I know, we're Jamba Juice fiends) and brought her home and put her on the couch and turned on her favorite cartoon (currently Peep and the Big Wide World) and she's been chilling out there ever since.
I can imagine them saying that it is my time to give back to my father for all he has done for me. That there are things I will be learning in this experience, marathon that it is. They would point out that it is an opportunity for me to develop and express a selfless love. And they would remind me that my father, even in his condition, matters to God. His soul is intact even as his mind is fading.

He takes you from a factory in Vermont with water so clean it is considered poisonous, to villages in India that have 24-hour-a-day cell phone service but no water service at all. Fishman has spent the last three years circling the globe - from Las Vegas to New Delhi - to uncover how the world of water is changing, and what the enormous implications are for each of us, no matter where we live.

After compiling a passel of such non-animation and not exclusively cartoon images, I have decided to launch them on their own blog: "Pacific SplendorLAnd", where they will not interfere with the winnowing but still vaguely animation-related ramblings here.The main thing I have enjoyed about doing these pieces is that they wind up being singular, self-contained compositions, as opposed to quick fragmented doodles on the one end of the spectrum; or artwork created as a stream of storytelling devices, such as a storyboard or an animation sequence on the other. So somehow this makes them want their own blog.

Roger Webster, who gives a rather simplistic view of the historical facts in his bedside book - "The Illustrated at the Fireside - Pg 56", gives some insight into how it came about that the British press of that time managed to frame Hermanus Potgieter as a rogue and a villain. At that time the Volksraad of the Transvaal had passed a law prohibiting barter with the local people, under a penalty of £37.10. The object of the law ---- now listen carefully, ---- was to keep the peace! The fact that someone was going to make lots of money was beside the point!
Can you tell from my reviews recently that it is getting colder outside? I truly love this time of year for beer. Don't get me wrong I love a good APA or IPA in the summer, but even more I enjoy a fine stout or porter during the colder months of the year. I've got a few bottles of this beer and this is my first one in a very long time for review. I am enjoying this beer while watching my Alma Mater Ball State keep their win streak alive against Miami of Ohio.

Johnny Cash has a famous song about the travails of a boy named Sue, and gossip columnists love to mock and condemn the absurd names celebrities give their offspring. It is certainly how to see how any kid could enjoy being called Apple or Trixibelle or Pilot Helikopter. But very common names can also be troublesome to their bearers. As a kid, I was asked with tiresome regularity whether I played the saxophone, and how well I could skate. I had the same name as a smooth-playing, cheesily moustachioed American jazz musician and a figure skater who had won gold on the Sarajevo ice at the 1984 Winter Olympics.
That place is delicious. Just walking through the door puts me in a better mood.

Then finally, they put me on depakote. I am mentioning this drug by name because I have heard from several other women that they believe depakote was the cause of this for them too, and a doctor at a California University said that he strongly, strongly believes that it gives PCOS to young women. Then I heard that some doctors have been instructed not to prescribe it to women under 40. Depakote won't own up to that and they knowingly let the doctors prescribe it (at least, until recently from what I hear). I don't want to get into who my sources are because I don't want to get anyone in trouble. It's very good for seizures, my brother had to take it for years and it kept him alive, but for Bipolar- not so much.

But it's not. Most school chicken nuggets have at least a zillion ingredients. Okay, I exaggerate. Maybe they have thirty-five. Modified corn starch, soy, beef extract and maltodextrin - among other things - are not something I'd want any human to have in moderation. The same goes for cupcakes. I'm not against cake, and I'm not against most traditions. Just the last two weekends I let my son sing happy birthday and consume cake. But it was my choice. I was there to be his "judgment," and he ate confections. But I also know he's not likely to eat cake for another whole year.

If a payment remains overdue for a set period, such as 60 or 90 days, the licensor will usually have the right to terminate the agreement without resort to arbitration. In some countries, this does not apply if the overdue payment is caused by a temporary banking or government problem.

The verdict? More likely to attract shoppers than Sir Can-A-Lot but a little too futuristic to be relevant in today's economy. Also, without ads it's missing a crucial selling point.
Apparently we aren't the only ones who are connectivity-deprived on the Island - the line to get in and get online starts at about 9 on a Tuesday morning (the library is heartlessly closed on Sunday and Monday) with people flopped about the lawn looking listless and bereft.

And the ending was fantabulous! A lot like Deathly Hallows. I only have one complaint here--and that is the writing. Not anything on a whole, but there were instances where Kagawa, to describe emotion, would write 'anger flared' and other feelings in the same way and it came off as kind of passive. It just distracted me a bit.
Now, I don't want to sound like I'm crapping on the whole movie, because I actually did enjoy it. I think they did some perfect casting with Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades. They are two of my favorite actors, and I can't think of any two people more perfect for those two roles. I also have a huge crush on the ruggedly handsome Sam Worthington, and Mads Mikkelson is pretty much great in everything he does, and this is no exception. My favorite part of the movie was the whole Medusa scene. From Io explaining the Medusa backstory to Perseus cutting off her head, it is amazing! Its nuts because they all survive these giant ass scorpions, and the three witches (also a cool scene.."a sacrifice!"), but they all drop like flies when it comes to Medusa. She doesn't even have to do anything. She looks at you...you die. End of story.

Alas, all these things (and more) would be nice. Having a real live person answer the phone when you call your phone company for assistance would be nice too, but those days are gone, for better or for worse. All these things would be nice, but we live in a technological era of continuously improving efficiencies (ie. if a computer can do it, let the computer do it). We also live in a sensitive and litigious era and for a potential employer to provide really honest feedback would open themselves up to human rights lawsuits and poor public relations. This is the era we live in and you can't change that. But what you can do is live with it and work through it. Besides, if an employer screens you out for any reason that would be a potential human rights issue,or anything that has absolutely nothing to do with your ability to excel in the job, chances are you don't want to work for that organization anyways.

"It's disappointing that the talks with the White House did not reach a favorable conclusion, and I appreciate the Speaker insisting on reduced spending and opposing the President's call for higher taxes on American families and job creators. It is similarly disappointing that the White House has refused to join Republicans in our effort to cut Washington spending now, cap runaway spending in the future and save our entitlement programs and our country from bankruptcy by requiring the nation to balance its budget. Speaker Boehner has informed us that he will work on a new path forward with Leader Reid to develop a solution that will prevent default, without job killing tax hikes, while substantially reducing Washington spending.

There was a problem with Shirley's printer which held up the order slightly and so she was extremely kind and sent me this other Love design as a special surprise, and it's now brightening up the side of my wardrobe. As mentioned before I do not like the wardrobes in my bedroom and they desperately need painting cream but now I see this pretty print instead of the wood and I just adore it. (Sorry for the reflections in the glass!)
The key to this entire problem was failure to understand Paul's ministry and message. Were Lysius to side with the Jews, he would be as lost as they. Fortunately, he had Paul in a semi-private audience. The Jews no longer had a gospel message for God was no longer dealing with them. To Paul was given the gospel of the grace of God for so we read in Ephesians 3:2.

Another one that has crept up in the last 2-3 years is where I can be, physically and literally exist and take up Jaime-shaped space, based on the weather.

Having just been exposed to tombs, mummies and the world of Hatshepsut full-throttle in a middle school text book, it seemed more fitting than ever to face the crowds and potential chaos with three kids ages 6 - 11, all in the name of seeing the real thing.

Let's examine the second half of the video. One protester calls out 'Mic check!,' and everyone knows what this means. This guy will speak for us, he has something to say. And if they disagree, they can simply stop passing this person's words along. But in this case he speaks words of de-escalation. We will let you police leave. He's teaching the police a lesson in non-violence. It's amazing to see this at work.

One of Geras' guest writers is British professor Eve Garrard, who in her latest post takes on writers Fintan O'Toole, from Ireland, and Iain Banks, from the UK.

Well, personally, I tend to spy a certain vulgarity when such impossibly subjective matters are stated like facts in this way (though I blame neither the brewery nor the organisers of this event for feeling the need to enter into the spirit of a good old public relations exercise every once in a while). I do also wonder whether an ale of such bloodcurdling power really ought to be hailed in this way on a global scale - looking at it from moral/public health perspective.

Anyway, we soon found out that if you never spoke, the zombie outbreak didn't happen to most people. Much like the movie Pontypool, where the virus had attached to language itself.

Last week saw another turn of direction for the brand with the news that the Genii Capital-owned F1 team has terminated its sponsorship agreement with Group Lotus. Financial uncertainty has surrounded Group Lotus since the investment arm of the Malaysian Government, Khazanah, selling its near on 43 percent stake in Lotus parent company Proton, to another Malaysian entity, DRB-Hicom. Those famous insiders surfaced in various reports saying that the sale of Proton was a contributing reason for Genii cancelling its sponsorship agreement.

I'm Unschooled. Yes, I Can Write. celebrated it's third birthday yesterday (though there wasn't much celebrating since I didn't realize until today that yesterday was the third anniversary of this blog!). When I started writing it, I had a vague idea that I wanted to prove to both myself, and whatever rare reader stumbled across my blog, that unschoolers really do learn things all the time. That unschooling really "works." But as I grew more confident in unschooling, and as my writing/blogging skills improved, I started to focus less on my-unschooling-life-as-it-happens, and more on the philosophy of unschooling, using my life to illustrate the points I was trying to make. I enjoyed (and still enjoy) writing that type of post. Apparently, so do other people! I started, as most blogs do, with virtually no readers (family doesn't count). And now, three years later, just through Blogger's follower tracker (which only counts people who have a Blogger account and choose to follow this blog through their account) I have nearly 430 followers. This blog's Facebook page has over 1,800 fans. This blog has gotten big! And through blogging, I'm speaking at a conference again this fall (possibly two, as I've been invited to a vague conference that may or may not be happening in Montreal, as well), am recognized by name at most education things I go to, and have been asked (though whether I say yes or not depends on a lot of things) for film, radio, article, and blog post interviews.

The ideas employed in foul play are given a false foundation but one that is seemingly real. They depend on the person to whom they present the ideas to mistake the reality. Thus the targeted person believes their somatic reactivity is evidence that the idea is real. And this is generally true. If we sense danger for instance, even though we don't have sensory information our body will move to fear because that is natural. It is the preparation of our body to face and deal with the danger. In foul play the danger card is play to cause the targeted person to mistakenly believe that the presented idea, of which they are more conscious, has led to their somatic arousal. This empowers the ideas. In reality the danger posed and the idea presented are unrelated. It is through trickery that the person targeted is brought along to believing in the ideas presented. And you will see that with certainty when you are no longer unsuspecting of the foul play having done the experiments and having seen how easily you can be manipulated while believing the medical misinformation. And that includes the psychiatric babble about misreading others if you are suspicious. What they are effectively saying is that you have to accept appearances at face value. That's self-serving garbage. When you have done the experiments and "wised up" or "level up" to use PC game parlance, then the foul game can't be played as to obtain a result. You can "walk through the valley of the shadow of death and fear no evil"! A knowledgeable person can stand against the evil mobs and win. I am living proof of that but you need to see that for yourselves. It is good for you to be sceptical of what I am presenting but please also be curious. This is not about some academic pursuit; this is a life and death matter. To be empowered and reap the benefits for yourselves you must realize the truth and not just know it.

It is nearly impossible to engender the necessary confidence, trust and loyalty a leader must possess without being fully engaged. A leader spends as much time out of the confines of the office engaging in real conversation with people as they do in their office planning, decision-making and organizing. Whether in person, over the phone, via email, through the social web, or even by sending a good old fashion "thank you" note - be an engaging conversationalist.
Now, this might sound all pretty straightforward, but Mieville's innovation is the locale. Beszel and Ul Qoma aren't neighboring cities like East and West Berlin, or Buda and Pest. Their streets and buildings literally co-occupy the same space. This creates an environment in which citizens of one city are required to "unsee" and "unhear" the citizens of the other, even though they might be walking down the same street or sitting on the same park bench. Monitoring everyone from both cities is the (almost) all-seeing secret police, Breach, which ruthlessly "disappears" offenders that break the rules of separation.

At two my son was a bruiser. He was more prone to hit you up side the head with a Tonka truck than he was to stroke your cheek. He knew nothing of what it was to "miss" someone and he had been with me all day so there would be no reason to say it, even if he knew what it meant. He was happy when I took him to the crib and happy to lay down for his nap so there was no reason for his chin to tremble with emotion. From that moment on I've had a peace in my heart with the knowledge that our loved ones don't really leave us, they just leave the vehicle we recognize. That was possibly one of the greatest gifts my mother ever gave to me! Thanks Mom!
The Chairman of the CFR is Robert E. Rubin, who served under Bill Clinton as Treasury Secretary and headed Clinton's National Economic Council. He was a Clinton crony. Rubin's ties to Clinton are interesting, since Bill Clinton was Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University, where he was close to the Jesuit faculty (became Class President in his junior year). Rubin has served on the board of the Center for National Policy (CNP), which is led by it's President, Roman Catholic Tim Roemer (A graduate of the Roman Catholic University of Notre Dame).
After compiling a passel of such non-animation and not exclusively cartoon images, I have decided to launch them on their own blog: "Pacific SplendorLAnd", where they will not interfere with the winnowing but still vaguely animation-related ramblings here.The main thing I have enjoyed about doing these pieces is that they wind up being singular, self-contained compositions, as opposed to quick fragmented doodles on the one end of the spectrum; or artwork created as a stream of storytelling devices, such as a storyboard or an animation sequence on the other. So somehow this makes them want their own blog.

She is taking her ugly duckling status hard. She shrieks her Skeksis complaint call at everyone and everything. The serama have taken to hiding from her, and even the other pekins are giving her a wide berth. The newspaper on the coop floor feels the brunt of her temper, and she is spending a lot of time shrieking in the coop and flinging strips of mutilated broadsheet out of the pop hole door. The others wisely let her go to bed first, and only venture in to the coop when she's settled down to sleep. No one risks perching next to her. To add insult to injury, I have smothered her in mite powder as a precaution. So now she looks like a middle aged, balding goth with dandruff. It's a hard look to rock, frankly.

Once you have your paper cut out in the size you want, I generally use my Xacto knife to score my folds (very gently, I really don't even push, just drag the blade gently across the paper). I score the "pretty side" of my paper, not the back. A ruler helps to keep your lines straight, if you don't trust yourself scoring the paper, you can also line up your ruler and fold against it to keep your folds crisp.

Written for ages 6 and older this is one of many delightful books in the Katie Woo series. I no longer have children or grandchildren this age but the title reminded me of my 8-year-old granddaughter (kind of a Madame Fullcharge) and I thought she and I would have fun reading it together. She wasn't interested. Said it was too young for her. That might be because she just finishing up her 4th grade brothers book, Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief. Anyway I thought the book was great and I still think she would have enjoyed it. I'll bet if I could have figured out how to get it onto Kindle she may have read it.
What is the proper response to betrayal? Or even the natural response? Jonas' mother shuns her son but, for many, there will be the often kneejerk response to pay the person back: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth and infidelity for infidelity. So they go out and screw the guy's best friend or the first person they meet in a bar. And that's what happens here. Not the best friend, the bar. When Eva finds out exactly what (or, to be more precise, who) her husband has been doing she goes out, picks up a guy in a bar, goes back to his flat and lets him have his way with her.
Sorry about the tedious post yesterday night, I was trying to keep myself awake, and I failed. I went to sleep shortly afterwards.
As someone with Type 1 diabetes (the "real" diabetes, as I like to put it -- the kind you can't help getting), I sometimes wonder when I'll end up retiring, or how long I can escape death. So I wonder how much I should be saving for retirement. Will I get the typical 25-30 year long retirement? Or would I have to retire at 40 to pull that one off? If I work until I'm 65, I could have lots put away, only to die within 2 years if I'm lucky, on the other hand.
How does this event foreshadow the ministry of the Levites? (As we will see later, the Levites will be chosen of all the tribes of Israel to attend to the Tabernacle and the religious service. "Then Moses said, 'You have been set apart to the Lord today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day." (Exodus 32:29 NIV))
Mendy, as much as I, found this almost too good to be true and a bit hard to believe, even though all sorts of wonderful beings show up in her office all the time. As she said later, though, she has a great deal of experience with this stuff and she feels confident of being able to sniff out a fraud. Stephen did not appear to be a fraud, not to either of us. I had a feeling of the sublime, no sense of anything that might raise an alarm.

-Kairo: A game about exploring massive, strange spaces and solving massive strange puzzles. It's. I don't know. If you're like me you're at half-mast just from the description. It's all well and good to shit on Myst and everything, but I just have a real love of exploring strange spaces. STALKER, for instance, was less about shooting shit for me and more about finding weird old soviet structures warped by strange radiation. Same with Fallout. Looking at something in the distance and finding out why it's there is just super cool. Like archaeology but with the boring edited out.
If there was an award for courage in the cricketing world, it should very well be named after Bob Willis. When he was 26, he had operations on both his knees, which meant he was in constant pain whenever he played. In fact, on certain days, he needed to run five miles in order to generate the strength to play. It was only through his will that Willis managed to play and succeed at the top level for nine more years. At 6 feet 6 inches, Willis was an intimidating fast bowler, one of the fastest England have ever produced. His pace, bounce, aggression and swing made him deadly on all kinds of pitches across the world.

Such determination in her work life goes hand in hand with sacrifices in her social life. She often finds herself declining invites to parties or social gatherings in favour of a few more hours sewing or attending a networking event. When this happens, Judith simply reminds herself "Well they are only drinking wine, I'm not really missing out on that much". This sort of perspective has helped her throughout her career.

In a big bookstore, I admit that I sometimes get overwhelmed by the selection and tend to gravitate towards what I already know. I really appreciate those times when I can savor very curated environments, whether it's a quirky selection (like the store I mentioned here) or the focus of a cookware or gardening store. I tend to spend more time with the books, and I while I can often leave Barnes & Noble without a book, I never leave a speciality store empty-handed.

Then I noticed, the refrigerator is on the fritz, yet again. It's turned up to nine and just barely keeping things cool. The repair man kept saying he was coming. Until the manager called him again at 6pm and he said, tomorrow. The manager said, and in the meantime their food is going bad.
But even getting out officially isn't easy. I believe that the US and its allies don't really give a tinker's curse about Afghanistan; as far as they are concerned, if the Afghans are intent on living in a barbaric medieval theocracy, where women are treated as chattels, those who don't share the faith of the rulers live in fear of death, and there're more or less continual low-level wars between various tribes, then they're welcome to do so. Admittedly, there is the poppy problem - Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of non-pharmaceutical grade opiates (92% in 2007) and also, incidentally, the world's largest producer of hashish - but, despite all the hype about the so-called War on Drugs, I have a feeling that (for all sorts of reasons, many sordid, which I won't go into here) the US and most other countries can live with that. No, the real problems are the two 500 pound
But The Phantom, it seems, has been histroically overshadowed by the truly staggering popular reception that greeted the debut of Superman, and his equally colourful cohorts (such as Batman, Captain America, et al), from the 1940s onwards. Perhaps he simply wasn't "super" enough to stand out amongst the growing throngs of super-powered crime-fighters that crowded American comic-books for the duration of World War II. Even as costumed superheroes reasserted their status (after a decade-long hiatus) as the dominant American comic-book genre throughout the 1960s, The Phantom remained a secondary character, despite earning his first self-titled American comic-book series in 1962.
After that we opened my bottle of Midnight Sun Arctic Devil. This one was just a straight English Barleywine aged in whiskey barrels for about four months.

Despite the horrid waste of taxpayer's money on the various green energy firms that keep failing, Obama blamed the Solyndra debacle on the Chinese who "were subsidizing their solar industry and flooding the market in ways that Solyndra couldn't compete." That was well known before the Solyndra half billion dollar loan guarantee was made, followed by still more to other solar companies.
Hi
The race organisers couldn't help the weather, but there was a lot throughout the day which showed that given the warning they had about the likelihood of poor weather, they could have performed a whole heap better than they did. This became abundantly clear from the start as only one entrance to the stadium was open though two were advertised in the programme - this meant all runners trying to get in and out through one gate. Pandemonium. At about this time - still with half an hour to go - organisers were trying to chivee everyone out of the stadium to start lining up at the start in the cold and wet.

There was a problem, though, in that, when they were attempting to insert a guide wire-thing into her esophagus, they popped a hole in her LARYNX. So, they had to take out all their guides and scopes and instruments while the doctor consulted with another laparoscopic doctor and an ENT to decide if this was a big deal. Apparently, it should heal on its own, provided there isn't any infection, so they just sewed up the hole, put everything back in, and finished the operation; hence, FIVE AND A HALF HOUR surgery.

I used to sell property and casualty insurance down in Sarasota Florida. I remember after I got licensed I was supposed to find a target niche for my prospecting efforts and develop a marketing strategy to target businesses within that niche. I picked professional liability after some quick success in that line of business and put together a prospect list of companies who I wanted to approach about writing their insurance. There was one account that I set my eyes on and really wanted to land. It was a large multi location diagnostics facility with large property and casualty exposures that would not only result in a challenge to structure but would land me a huge commission if I could write the account.
I'm sitting here at 10am in a condo that is much more empty than it was 12 hours ago. My tv is gone, my coffee table is gone, and most importantly the boxes of my exes stuff that i had hidden behind the couch for the past 5 months is gone. I didn't know how it would go today. My last relationship was a tricky one. I'd have to say it was honestly the worst and most dysfunctional relationship I've ever had in my entire life (i've had a total of 3 boyfriends).

It's also not clear how much we should cheer the 64.6 percent increase in the number of Black-owned non-employer firms. Average revenues at these firms dropped 10.7 percent in real terms between 2002 and 2007. Perhaps more importantly, in 2007 the average revenue at a Black-owned non-employer firm was only $18,500 (in 2002 dollars).

I still don't really know how I will accomplish this task, I just know that I must. I need an exercise montage. I need abdominal muscles.

Services from a specialized mechanic are explicit and therefore attract charges and service fees where they are due. The mechanic takes time to evaluate the problem before repairing or recommending a replacement. With skill and experience in dealing with a specific vehicle structure, the mechanic finds it an easy task to correct an anomaly and is therefore likely to charge less.
But this movie is not made for people like me. It is made for a different demographic, which is fine. I knew it going in, but I had heard enough to suggest it would have, like, cross-subcultural appeal. It did not. I would almost rather watch a regular romcom/dramedy or whatever this was because at least it isn't trying to pretend it's all that different from the mainstream.
It was so cute. SOOOOO CUTE. Take a look at this photo, which I didn't want to copy here because it's copyrighted, to get an idea of the cuteness of this mouse. It was about the size of a quarter.

At the wheel of Falken Tire's Porsche 911 GT3 RSR, the winning car at Mid-Ohio and Baltimore, Bryan Sellers (USA) posted the ninth quickest time. He contests the race with Porsche factory pilot Wolf Henzler (Germany). "We didn't have an optimal set-up today, but we know that our car and the tyres will perform much better in the race than in the qualifying," explained Bryan Sellers. Wolf Henzler added: "The circuit was very cold over the last days. Today we have sun and the asphalt temperatures were suddenly much higher. That changed everything. Our team still simply lacks the experience of reacting to such changes in a short timeframe."
Eliminate mold. Keeping warm air out and dehumidifiers and air conditioners on helps keep your air fresh and also prevents mold from growing.

The Princess and the Pea by Hans Christian Anderson
In five stories, Christie allows the murderer to escape justice (and in the case of the last three, implicitly almost approves of their crimes); these are The Witness for the Prosecution, The Man in the Brown Suit, Murder on the Orient Express, Curtain and The Unexpected Guest. (When Christie adapted Witness into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed.) There are also numerous instances where the killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but instead dies (death usually being presented as a more 'sympathetic' outcome), for example Peril at End House, Death on the Nile, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Crooked House, Appointment with Death, The Hollow, and Secret Adversary. In some cases this is with the collusion of the detective involved. Five Little Pigs, and arguably Ordeal by Innocence, end with the question of whether formal justice will be done unresolved.

We stood outside their house and hugged and prayed over them. I held each of them tight until they cried. They needed a mother's love and protection and the feel of safet, if only for a moment. I kissed them all over their faces and told them I loved them and we would see them again, and help them in the meantime. Isabelle and Johnny begged to give them all the food we had in the van, so we asked them to walk back with us. We walked down that path to the van, praying the whole way. I didn't know until later that night after looking at the pictures that we were all holding hands. Isabelle and Johnny love these girls too, and their hearts were broken and changed that day too.

That view, of connections to one another, could have begun in the ancient Jewish belief of blessings and cursings. The translators of Christ's words may have been a bit leery of the idea of cursing someone. "Blessed are the meek" was fine. But cursing the un-meek? Did they change the words so that we read now the easier-to-digest "woe unto him"? As in, perhaps, "woe unto him who hurts the least of these, the children." . Sounds safe enough until you realize this may be an example of the Jewish belief in cursing someone, in proclaiming your hope in his receiving his just desserts for a particular behavior. Pedophilia, anyone?

I still believe in the standard of care that most midwives provide for low-risk, uncomplicated pregnancies and births. I do believe that when I started bleeding at 15 weeks, the midwife should have bowed out of my care. I do believe that when I was sure my water broke at 18 weeks, she should have bowed out of my care. I don't blame midwives in general. I'm not even sure I blame her specifically. I should have spoken up. I should have insisted on an ultrasound. I should have asked for a second opinion. I didn't. At the least, we share blame. At the most, as his mother, the blame falls on me for not protecting him.
I followed my parent's home, even though they weren't aware of my presense. My mom wept all the way while my dad remained silent. He begged my mom to calm down but it all fell on deaf ears. We got home to find the house filled with friends and relatives, my Dad carried my body and laid it on the mat in the living room. Prayers for forgiveness were said, and my parents were advised to stop crying as it wouldn't bring me back. I watched my Mom cry and weep all night as she asked God why He Had to take my life.

(There's actually an entertaining theory to be spun here. The fact that the Doctor knows he meets Nyssa in his fourth incarnation means that he cannot regenerate until he does. This corresponds perfectly with his cockier and more domineering demeanor in the Williams era. And after meeting Nyssa in this story he becomes deeply sulky and funerial, as if he knows the jig is up. Of course, the idea that he's just grumpy about losing Romana is probably the better account.)

Reaching goals requires motivation. ZenHabits does a nice job of explaining motivation, as well as ways to achieve it and sustain it during times of struggle. To find out more about motivation, check out the self-motivation quiz from Mindtools. After the quiz, there is a nice explanation of factors involved in self-motivation including: self-confidence and efficacy, positive thinking, focus, and environment. The author from the article How Self-Motivated Are You noted, "Self-motivation doesn't come naturally to everyone. And even those who are highly self-motivated need some extra help every now and then. Build your self-motivation by practicing goal-setting skills, and combining those with positive thinking, the creation of powerful visions of success, and the building of high levels of self-efficacy and self-confidence."
Given NuLabour's visceral hatred and contempt for the white working class, who's interests so often conflicts with those now much preferred groups, many observers would have assumed that Denham was either making a bad joke and had forgotten the punchline, or was suffering from some catastrophic mental breakdown, had they, that is, not realised that an election is imminent.

The Territory is often referred to as the 'Top End' and is also home to 'the Alice' and 'the Red Centre'. It has plenty of 'Outback' and 'Dreamtime Land' and a rather large portion of extreme 'bugger all'.

That's about it.
I went to the front desk and explained what happened and luckily they did give us a room (it would have been a long trip home!). We got the same type of room, same rate, but it was a handicapped accessible room. They probably hold those rooms back in case they are needed. I don't know yet if I got charged for our missed night. I had reserved the room with a card that I subsequently canceled (due to fraud). So I don't know if they would have been able to charge it or not.
I have to leave for the airport right now but I just wanted to post the news this morning since I was too tired from the celebrating to post last night.

The key to this entire problem was failure to understand Paul's ministry and message. Were Lysius to side with the Jews, he would be as lost as they. Fortunately, he had Paul in a semi-private audience. The Jews no longer had a gospel message for God was no longer dealing with them. To Paul was given the gospel of the grace of God for so we read in Ephesians 3:2.
Anyone who has sung in a cathedral choir in Britain or Ireland will know and love Stanford's church music, which set a standard and started a vigorous tradition what extended almost to the present day. But what I am uploading is one of his piano concertos, played with great verve by the young Irish pianist Finghin Collins. It's classic Stanford - you can hear a nod to Rachmaninoff in the first movement, but the bluff, muscular energy is very much Stanford. I played the first piano quartet a while back, and you notice the same thing - you have to dig into the music from bar one (literally for the strings, who have a wonderful flourish to open the work).

Alan was born in the Auvergnat town of Riom. His father Georges (Jord in Breton) Cochevelou was a civil servant in the French Ministry of Finance who achieved his dream of recreating a Celtic or Breton harp in the small town of Gourin, Brittany. In 1953, Alan began playing the instrument at the age of nine under the tutelage of his father and Denise Megevand, a concert harpist. Alan also learned Celtic mythology, art and history as well as the Breton language, traditional Breton dance and the Scottish bagpipe and the bombarde, a traditional Breton instrument, from the oboe family. Alan began playing concerts at eleven years and studying traditional Breton, English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh folk music, also learning the drum, Irish flute, and tin whistle. He competed in and won several Breton traditional music competitions in the Bleimor Pipe band. Alan spent his childhood in Paris, with its cosmopolitan influences from France, Algeria, Morocco and elsewhere. But he fell in love with Breton music and Celtic culture in general, and often went back in his teens to Brittany.
The "father of the H-bomb" was to his supporters a hero of the Cold War and to his detractors, the personification of the mad scientist. Between these extremes, an intriguing biographer emerges in Judging Edward Teller by Istvan Hargittai ($32.00, Prometheus Books). Teller was no shrinking flower. In addition to his prodigious intelligence he was, as one observer noted, "a monomaniac with many manias." He gained fame or infamy depending on one's point of view, when he denounced J. Robert Oppenheimer who led the team that created the A-bomb that ended the war with Japan, but was seen as a communist sympathizer. He is recalled for his fierce opposition to nuclear test bans during the Cold War and, toward the end of his life, as an advocate for the Strategic Defense Initiative. In retrospect, his excesses may well have contributed to the demise of the Soviet Union. He became the prototype for "Dr. Strangelove", but in truth Teller was a patriot who was totally devoted to the defense of the United States. Anyone with an interest in science and this history of the turbulent times of his life will find the book an excellent, absorbing biography.

Let me tell you, I previously loved Gerard Butler's Phantom but Ramin Karimloo's Phantom made me want to hop through my television set, kick Christine out of the picture and run away with him on the streets of Paris. He was AMAZING with a gorgeous voice and so much raw, sexy emotion. Despite kicking her to the side for the Phantom the gorgeous Sierra Boggess was an awesome Christine with an amazingly hypnotic voice. The height of the play where they sang the theme song was filled with such romance and emotion. I also fell in love with the Music of the Night from Ramin's emotionally raw and sexy voice. I had to grab the soundtrack after to relive the experience over and over again. I simply fell in love with the production!

SkyWest's total operating revenues increased $55.2 million, or 6.4%, during the quarter ended March 31, 2012, over the same period in 2011. The increase in operating revenues was the result of higher pass-through costs (primarily fuel and engine overhaul costs) under SkyWest's agreements with its major partners and an increase in block hour production. The increase in operating revenues was offset by a planned reduction in prorate flying block hours of 13.4% resulting in reduced revenues of approximately $6.0 million. In spite of the reducing operating revenues from prorate flying, SkyWest's revenue per available seat mile for this flying increased 14.6% from improved pricing. After excluding the increased pass-through costs of approximately $31.1 million, for fuel and engine overhauls, and the reduction in prorate flying revenue of $6.0, total operating revenues increased approximately $30.1 million due to the additional block hour production of 3.1% and improved utilization. Total block hours for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 were 556,421 compared to 539,910 for the same period last year.

If there was an award for courage in the cricketing world, it should very well be named after Bob Willis. When he was 26, he had operations on both his knees, which meant he was in constant pain whenever he played. In fact, on certain days, he needed to run five miles in order to generate the strength to play. It was only through his will that Willis managed to play and succeed at the top level for nine more years. At 6 feet 6 inches, Willis was an intimidating fast bowler, one of the fastest England have ever produced. His pace, bounce, aggression and swing made him deadly on all kinds of pitches across the world.

All that and more is depicted in movies such as Gods and Generals, the miniseries North and South, or many books including the Bernard Cornwell novel of 1993, The Rebel, in his the Starbuck Chronicles series.
Personally, I am a fan of books like this that help bridge the gap to help children graduate from reading Bible picture books to actually digesting Scripture. And while it is not a homeschool "curriculum", it would certainly adapt well as a Bible curriculum, especially if your family enjoys the New Living Translation. On the other hand, children this age are incredibly impressionable. They are thinking and absorbing so much. It is time to sharpen up on your theology. I have read some Bible storybooks where the stories are retold in a way that uses soft theology or even sways the story by adding (or omitting) details to the original text. The mere fact that someone picks and chooses only certain Bible stories to retell means that the person has at least some control of what the final presentation looks like. In this book, Carolyn Larsen has condensed the Scripture to retell each story, but (as you can see from the one example above) she is merely eliminating details that may cause a young brain (or even my old brain) to scatter and wander. It brings the story focus, and keeps the truth. Larsen has taken the opportunity to use the "Now What" section to tie in the big picture of the Gospel right from the beginning. For me, this is an essential element that I look for in a good book. One of the first things I did was flip to the back of the book to the stories telling of Jesus' death and resurrection and the early church. I read through the "Now What" sections looking for any details that may tell my child how or why to become saved. At first, it appeared that I wouldn't find what I was looking for. Disappointed, I flipped to Genesis. There it was. With the telling of Adam and Eve's sin, came the Gospel. Right at the beginning, exactly where it was needed. We need a Savior and here's why and here is where you can find Him.
Thanks for your patience
My memoir on adopting my daughter from China was perhaps the hardest thing I ever wrote mainly because at the same time that I was trying to understand what was going on, what this sudden unexpected journey in the middle of my life actually meant, to capture in words what it actually felt like- I was trying to get others to understand, to feel all of this at the same time.

O LORD, open my eyes so I may see.
Most sites have titled it "The Cab Ride" or The Taxi Driver," but Nerburn's original title reflects the soul-filled insights of a man with a doctoral degree in religious studies. He calls it: "And where there is sadness, joy."..
Thus, no doubt soon you will probly hear soon some business leaders or pretend potential self-appointed communist leaders lamenting the lack of organization of the #Occupy movements, describing them as "in choate" (which is a kind of wide penis with no head), or "udderless," or "lacking discernible goals" (like Sporting Gijon). What they are really mean is that there is a ferment of new ideas that therefore could be dangerous and must be curtailed, or at least curtopped. After all, nobody has any idea where a march that goes nowhere might end up. If these peoples weren't too feckless to emigrate we could at least lure them onto a ferry with the promise of jobs in Australia and transport them there. We would never hear of them ever again! But while they are there, in the midst of ordinary, heads-down, knees-back God-fearing punters, fermenting theories without limitations and trying out new processes, such as democracy-never a positive development-they constitute a threat to our docile, passive, obedient way of life. They must be stomped on by square-headed baton-wielding riot police, preferably from up the country, before any new ideas seep out into the public body at large, like a ball of ideological pus.

Anyway, we soon found out that if you never spoke, the zombie outbreak didn't happen to most people. Much like the movie Pontypool, where the virus had attached to language itself. So a lot of us were walking from room to room, but really keeping conversation at a minimum, or not at all. Things were looking up near the end, but the whole dream was still kind of disturbing.
God's promises:
Soon I'll put up a list of what I've been doing, lately - enough to start my own Home Improvement Channel. But for now . . . a video of one of my favorite things of 2011, filmed on and behind our block.
Brown silk with little yellow and magenta flowers, above knee length, with a tulip skirt, pockets on the hips and a fitted waist. I think it's Anne Klein though the label is gone, it was an expensive dress for me back then, just beginning college. It was barely warm enough to wear it today, as it is sleeveless, with a yellow shrug sweater over it. (And a coat for going outside!)
At around dusk, Emi asked if I wanted to go for a walk in the woods, and of course I said yes. We picked up a friend of hers on the way. It rained this afternoon, and everything had that fresh, sweet smell that you always get after rain in the spring time. The Peepers were deafening as we picked our way through the slick mud, over wet rocks, and through damp grasses, fending off mosquitoes as we went. Emi tried to catch a frog (it was brown, though we're not sure what type it was.) as we wound our way through the flooded areas, looking for peepers and other frogs. We saw the colour of the sky through the trees as the sun set.

Next, write down all the skills you need to learn or to work on. If you are just getting started with writing, you may find this difficult. If people have made comments on your writing, you can use those comments to make your list. If, for instance, you have been told that your characters are not believable or your descriptions fuzzy, then the skills of creating characters and writing description go on your list. Or try this: read over a piece of writing by your favorite author, writing you consider excellent. Now write down all the things the writer does that make this piece so good. How many of these things can you do now? How many of them do you need to learn how to do?
I started with Indus, an IPA. It looked to be pouring a bit flat and it took a bit of coaxing to get a loose-bubbled head to form on the top. It didn't last long. However the beer really benefits from the low carbonation as it creates a wonderful cask-like effect, with just enough sparkle to push the flavours out. Naturally enough, it's hops out front: good honest English varieties by the taste of them, with lots of floral orange blossom laid on quite intensely, creating almost a resinous burn while staying clean and crisp, avoding all harshness. At 4.6% ABV it's around a percentage point weaker than the likes of White Shield and Bengal Lancer, but I'd regard it as being very much in the same league. The balance of marmalade and toffee you get in the others isn't present here, but the hop punchiness makes up for it for me. Tangy, sinkable and with a lasting bitterness, I really enjoyed it.
A. I wrote my first picture books when I was three years old. Actually I drew the pictures and my mom helped me write the story. Then I wrote my first novel when I was in ninth grade. It took me all year, and it was pretty terrible. But when I finished, I wrote another book and another and another. During my senior year, after I'd finished a fantasy novel, I went to a writing conference and pitched an agent. But I was too sensitive and I didn't really know anything about the industry, and it didn't go well. I left the conference thinking that publishing wasn't for me. I knew I would always write, but I figured I wouldn't really pursue being published. I wrote consistently after that but never really showed my writing to anyone. Then a year and a half ago I started writing Unraveling and joined a writing group for fun. They really loved it and encouraged me to let an agent take a look.
If I had a majority of 29 seats in Parliament and me and my ministers were actually "Serving the People", I'd have nothing to worry about..I wouldn't need to hold 3 public meetings in one week, deploy hundreds of people on websites and generally look like I've been caught with my underwear around my ankles!

Schirmbeck on Wednesday filed a formal complaint over the matter with Galveston County District Attorney Jack Roady. He also asked for an investigation into whether the city's use of public funds on pro-camera advertising on the public access television channel 16 and on the city's website violates state election law. In November, residents will have a chance to vote on whether to continue the photo ticketing program. Schirmbeck believes the slick video material was produced by Redflex, but the commercials did not disclose their true origin, in violation of state campaign laws.

I don't know.maybe nobody else feels like this about indie publishing. But this is sort of where I think I am with it. It's wonderful on so many levels - but its big flaw, I think, is that it's just too easy. Too easy to implement.too easy to mess up.too easy to get discouraged (because your frame of reference when you're solo is really quite small). Too easy, essentially, to jump in when you're green and flounder around.because you're green.

Tennessee invoked the rule for the 1975 season, during the time when the maximum number of scheduled games was eleven. That season, the Vols traveled to Honolulu for their 12th scheduled game, winning 28-6. There were four non-conference games at home on the schedule that season - Maryland, North Texas State, Colorado State, and Utah - with a fifth on the road (UCLA). I don't know which of those four home NC games was the extra one added due to the Hawaii game. I hope it wasn't North Texas State - the worst Volunteer loss I personally ever witnessed.

And so I began. I used the instructions I found online as my chief guide but after three days I was a little skeptical that the sour dough had fermented enough or produced enough yeast. My Twitter friend Finn said that he had been feeding his starter ("Veruca") for 12 days and it was now time. So I asked him if he thought my starter was ready? He confirmed what I thought and said no. So I've been letting "Finn Jr". grow and grow. Last night he became a rebellious teenager and we woke up to him trying to escape the safety of his jar to explore the world (thus the picture above this posting).
A pipe dream, I know, as so many see the wheels as an extension of their existence. Could one really expect all the insecure men fearful about the size of their penises to not hop into these big trucks so they can feel big in the world? It is human men like this who are behind the wars and the need t smash things.
I also feel a change coming in me. I prefer to stay at home, or go for a quiet dinner, or watch a movie. I don't like clubbing anymore, or going and getting "wasted" which is what most of my friends do. Nothing wrong with that at all. But I am just not there anymore. My idea of a good night out now is relaxing at home with a good movie, or going to a cinema, or cooking dinner, or going out to eat. If alcohol must be involved, a nice quiet bar where we can sit and talk.

That's it. There aren't really any short cuts. People always want short cuts. New acts often want to know how to get an agent. The chances are that any act asking how to get an agent doesn't really need an agent. And when they're at a stage where an agent can help them, they'll find there are agents there offering to help. That's how it works.

He also sought to break from the class-conscious conventions of the 1930s and early 40s, when top hat and tails or tuxedos were the norm, by dancing in casual or everyday work clothes, so as to make his dancing more relevant to the cinema-going public. As his first wife, actress and dancer Betsy Blair explained: "A sailor suit or his white socks and loafers, or the T-shirts on his muscular torso, gave everyone the feeling that he was a regular guy, and perhaps they too could express love and joy by dancing in the street or stomping through puddles.he democratized the dance in movies."[14] In particular, he wanted to create a completely different image from that associated with Fred Astaire, not least because he believed his physique didn't suit such refined elegance: "I used to envy his cool aristocratic style, so intimate and contained. Fred wears top hat and tails to the manner born - I put them on and look like a truck driver."[2]

Alan was born in the Auvergnat town of Riom. His father Georges (Jord in Breton) Cochevelou was a civil servant in the French Ministry of Finance who achieved his dream of recreating a Celtic or Breton harp in the small town of Gourin, Brittany. In 1953, Alan began playing the instrument at the age of nine under the tutelage of his father and Denise Megevand, a concert harpist. Alan also learned Celtic mythology, art and history as well as the Breton language, traditional Breton dance and the Scottish bagpipe and the bombarde, a traditional Breton instrument, from the oboe family. Alan began playing concerts at eleven years and studying traditional Breton, English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh folk music, also learning the drum, Irish flute, and tin whistle. He competed in and won several Breton traditional music competitions in the Bleimor Pipe band. Alan spent his childhood in Paris, with its cosmopolitan influences from France, Algeria, Morocco and elsewhere. But he fell in love with Breton music and Celtic culture in general, and often went back in his teens to Brittany.

It is nearly impossible to engender the necessary confidence, trust and loyalty a leader must possess without being fully engaged.

And you, my sweet, from head to feet
Have decided that I can't skip basic grooming or else I feel like crapola. So my feet are next, but I've decided that I need to be more consistent with the shaving, the eyebrows, and the hands too. Being "too tired" is no excuse, because I honestly think it's a vicious cycle. I'm too tired to shave, so I don't. And then the next day I can't wear a cute dress because I still haven't shaved. So I wear my jeans AGAIN. I don't blow-dry my hair, I don't put on makeup, I put on R's giant fleece cuz it's the only thing that closes over my belly, and then I stick on a baseball cap. What is the result? It ain't pretty. And it don't make me feel so good. So I have even less energy for shaving the next day. I'm not saying it's time for stilettos again, but I do think there is a happy medium. And now that I'm not teaching anymore, surely I have a little more time in my day for some primping.

WEALTHY FAMILIES: The first is wealthy families where the older generation has retired or is nearing retirement. Typically, their income is secure and they're concerned primarily with wealth protection and transfer. Agents may find that these wealthy families can take underutilized or under-performing assets and convert them to a permanent life insurance policy, often with the added advantage of a LTC rider. This strategy helps secure their wealth and makes it possible to pass on their assets to heirs in a tax-advantaged way, as well as assuring their long-term security if they need care.

I hope he's found his way to safety, it's a jungle out there.

It just so happened that the idea of dissociative disorders were just beginning to be formed by psychologists in the late 1800s. Starting in the 1880s, to be more exact. Prior to this, these types of episodes as RLS describes in Jekyll and Hyde would have been attributed to demon possession, but psychologists were just realizing that traumatic events in life could cause long-term disorders. It was into this intellectual field that Jekyll and Hyde sprang, and it changed the way psychology looked at dissociative identity disorders.

Those were the favorites and the first to disappear. Tali also ate the apples and sampled the cucumbers. Ana ate tomatoes, oranges, apples, cucumbers, and celery. She sampled the peppers. Amanda ate everything after arranging it all neatly on her plate. We didn't get to the pineapple so we'll try that at snack time.

Montana is the latest establishment in the ever-growing stable of cool-kid haunts owned and operated by Paris graffiti artist-turned-entrepreneur, Monsieur André. He's made a packet for himself by buying up interesting old bars and turning them into dens of beautiful-people iniquity. He launched his Paris bar empire with Le Baron, in the 8th arrondissement, a former brothel that, about four years ago became the place to see, be seen and dance ironically to hits of the 80s.

But, you know, if that cute guy who just walked his dog by as I sit writing this on my stoop happens to come back and ask me out to dinner in the village, who would I be to turn him down?

Buckinghamshire based Alt. Rockers Young Guns are the headliners for The Big Cheese Cave on Sunday 15th July.

I also feel a change coming in me. I prefer to stay at home, or go for a quiet dinner, or watch a movie. I don't like clubbing anymore, or going and getting "wasted" which is what most of my friends do. Nothing wrong with that at all. But I am just not there anymore. My idea of a good night out now is relaxing at home with a good movie, or going to a cinema, or cooking dinner, or going out to eat. If alcohol must be involved, a nice quiet bar where we can sit and talk.
And a third apparently young user said that "these questions are ridiculous, and impossible for me to answer. I haven't had a job, a car, or my first kiss yet, making it impossible for me to answer three of the five questions. Now I can't download anything from iTunes."

My mobile phone rings. It's my daughter's school. She has fallen over and has "a small hole" in her head. I finish my work at ten times the usual speed (I'd like to know how to do that) and head for the nearby hospital. On the roads, nobody seems to understand I'm in a rush and cars loiter and arc lazily. When I arrive finally, she is sitting on her teacher's lap, draped in a blanket as they wait to be seen. She seems dazed. I hug her and take a look at the cut. It looks as though she has been caught by a stray stud in a ruck. Her teacher tells me how loud the thump was when her head hit the floor, which is not something I really want to recap.

Keep getting a few Spark People Live meetings under my belt every week. The accountability, information, and friendship is exactly what I need to continue being successful.
Now that a few days have passed, I look back on that Chrysalis weekend with such joy. I don't think about the logistics of it all, I think about how present God was throughout it. With God's help, that weekend was flawless. And as I sat on Sunday listening to these girls talk about how positively affected they were by this weekend.. I knew at that very instant that every bit of sweat and tears was worth it.
Stomachs dropped at the images of Justice, a mixed breed puppy that was doused in lighter fluid and set ablaze earlier this month. He had second and third-degree burns over 70 percent of his body and died 10 days later.

Honeybees, like ants and termites, are considered super-organisms. This means that although the colony is made up of many individuals, none of the individuals can survive without the comradery of one another. The queen, workers and drones each have their job, and each job is essential for the survival of the colony. The swarm of bees occurs for many reasons, not enough space is the most common reason, and when it does happen, it is the equivalent of a colony of bees giving birth to another colony. Leaving the hive in this swarm is the mother of the bees from the initial hive, some her loyal workers, and some drones in a massive, incredible, engagingly powerful performance. They leave the 'parent hive' looking for new nesting grounds, and in the parent hive they just left, grows a new queen, hatching out young sister bees eager to usher her in to the culture of the hive and ensure her safety in her mating flight and new role as new mother of the colony. All of this is done through the true interdependence, constant plebiscites, and instantaneous communication of the colony.. lol.. much like our society works right? Well, in a community with the Hive Mentality it does!

Under both systems, sacrifice is invoked as a magic, omnipotent solution in any crisis-and "the public good" is the altar on which victims are immolated. But there are stylistic differences of emphasis. The socialist-communist axis keeps promising to achieve abundance, material comfort and security for its victims, in some indeterminate future. The fascist-Nazi axis scorns material comfort and security, and keeps extolling some undefined sort of spiritual duty, service and conquest. The socialist-communist axis offers its victims an alleged social ideal. The fascist-Nazi axis offers nothing but loose talk about some unspecified form of racial or national "greatness." The socialist-communist axis proclaims some grandiose economic plan, which keeps receding year by year. The fascist-Nazi axis merely extols leadership-leadership without purpose, program or direction-and power for power's sake.

We had a wonderful weekend with the family! Of course I spent too much money on the grandkids, but I enjoyed every minute of it. Too bad we have to go back to work today.

Now, this might sound all pretty straightforward, but Mieville's innovation is the locale. Beszel and Ul Qoma aren't neighboring cities like East and West Berlin, or Buda and Pest. Their streets and buildings literally co-occupy the same space. This creates an environment in which citizens of one city are required to "unsee" and "unhear" the citizens of the other, even though they might be walking down the same street or sitting on the same park bench. Monitoring everyone from both cities is the (almost) all-seeing secret police, Breach, which ruthlessly "disappears" offenders that break the rules of separation.

That brings us to a situation that I am ashamed to even to bring up, but feel that I must as part of my healing process. Hubby has put me on shoe detention. Actually, he advised that I had to get rid of a pair for every new pair I bought. Now ladies, I know I don't have to tell you how utterly unfair and unjust this mandate is. I don't have any shoes that I don't want!
This book presents and discusses the economic and trade relations between the United States, Canada and Mexico. Topics discussed include Canada-U.S. relations; the United States-Canada trade and economic relationship; NAFTA and the future of commercial trucking across the Mexican border and the Cuban migration to the United States.
I want to start with talking about Sawyer and Kate because I believe that this relationship was arguably the more apparent of the two, definitely the more active and perhaps even the more popular choice for indifferent/casual viewers. Why? Because Sawyer and Kate together was the obvious choice, the easy choice, and the in many ways expected direction for the characters to head in.

If you read my previous blog "A Master Baker I am Not" then you know that I'm on a quest to scatter flour from hither to yon, so when I saw this recipe White Lily Light Yeast Rolls, I thought hmmmm, are they really light? Only one way to find out . . . . bake up a batch. OMGBN! Not only are they light they are yummeelicious.
The story gets odder from there:
Personally, I am a fan of books like this that help bridge the gap to help children graduate from reading Bible picture books to actually digesting Scripture. And while it is not a homeschool "curriculum", it would certainly adapt well as a Bible curriculum, especially if your family enjoys the New Living Translation. On the other hand, children this age are incredibly impressionable. They are thinking and absorbing so much. It is time to sharpen up on your theology. I have read some Bible storybooks where the stories are retold in a way that uses soft theology or even sways the story by adding (or omitting) details to the original text. The mere fact that someone picks and chooses only certain Bible stories to retell means that the person has at least some control of what the final presentation looks like. In this book, Carolyn Larsen has condensed the Scripture to retell each story, but (as you can see from the one example above) she is merely eliminating details that may cause a young brain (or even my old brain) to scatter and wander. It brings the story focus, and keeps the truth. Larsen has taken the opportunity to use the "Now What" section to tie in the big picture of the Gospel right from the beginning. For me, this is an essential element that I look for in a good book. One of the first things I did was flip to the back of the book to the stories telling of Jesus' death and resurrection and the early church. I read through the "Now What" sections looking for any details that may tell my child how or why to become saved. At first, it appeared that I wouldn't find what I was looking for. Disappointed, I flipped to Genesis. There it was. With the telling of Adam and Eve's sin, came the Gospel. Right at the beginning, exactly where it was needed. We need a Savior and here's why and here is where you can find Him.

But the struggle that I have
We thought that jobs were good and that our organizations were designed to compete. I certainly thought that and I was a SVP HR for a very large bank.
So, adoptive families must be more exact with their questions, since many of them probably would argue that baby-buying is corruption. Instead of asking, "Do you feel there is wide-spread corruption in China's program?" a better question might be "Do you feel that paying substantial amounts of money for children is adoption corruption? And how wide-spread do you feel this baby-buying is?" It may be that he hedges, like the villager in the opening story, out of a reluctance to air China's dirty laundry, for there is one characteristic of the Chinese that I understand very well, having lived with one for seven years: The Chinese do not like to reveal the dirty secrets of their country, even to friends. It is a tradition and understanding that goes back hundreds of years. We might view it as lying, but the Chinese consider it "saving face."

The Chairman of the CFR is Robert E. Rubin, who served under Bill Clinton as Treasury Secretary and headed Clinton's National Economic Council. He was a Clinton crony. Rubin's ties to Clinton are interesting, since Bill Clinton was Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University, where he was close to the Jesuit faculty (became Class President in his junior year). Rubin has served on the board of the Center for National Policy (CNP), which is led by it's President, Roman Catholic Tim Roemer (A graduate of the Roman Catholic University of Notre Dame).
Not only did I rework that original block, but I have since done more applique' work (that Scrappy Dresden Plate quilt I'm working on requires applique', as do the monthly minis for Sandy's monthly QAL) and now in charge of the design for our next guild Opportunity (raffle) Quilt for 2014. Do you know what I've chosen for us to do? You guessed it if you said, "an applique' quilt"! I'll save that whole story for another day, but for now, I want to tell you about an idea that our friend, Flo shared during our coffee group.
The biggest thing is with Oldest and her boyfriends daughter, who's 3. The mom just up and left for the 4th time, leaving the daughter with Oldest and Boyfriend. No contact for over a month! Oldest and Boyfriend went to a lawyer to see what they could do, and the lawyer said NOTHING. Yep, nothing. A judge in our county won't rule against a mom who has several domestic violence charges called to her home, who has pulled a gun on her current boyfriend several times, has a mental illness, and has had several attempted suicides!
One day he caught me and I tried to listen to his bizarre imaginings. I felt sorry for him. A couple of his teeth were gone. But he was too loud, too edgy, too nonsensical. Never again. He can have my change. But this performance? I don't have the time.

I'm also in love with Frannie's family! Her parents are charming and protective. She has four other sisters (one named Maggie!) who are fun whenever they're included. Really, I think all of the side characters help liven the story and make it more realistic.
Ha, HA! See, I talked about the cultural impact of the electronic forum. It makes people impatient. impatient with stuff like reading! Death of the novel-yada, yada. I talked about it before.
Person of Interest. Started out good, then fell flat. Can't say why.
It is nearly impossible to engender the necessary confidence, trust and loyalty a leader must possess without being fully engaged. A leader spends as much time out of the confines of the office engaging in real conversation with people as they do in their office planning, decision-making and organizing. Whether in person, over the phone, via email, through the social web, or even by sending a good old fashion "thank you" note - be an engaging conversationalist.
...I am going to define impatience as a strong sense of annoyance at the (usually) unintentional faults and failures of others. This impatience is often expressed verbally in a way that tends to humiliate the person (or persons) who is the object of the impatience.

It is obvious then that there is a want by the consumer and a need advocated by the government for this product, and now that the technologies have become accessible it has become financially viable to enter this market.

A movie like Red Tails which narrates the lives of such upstanding historical figures are exactly what the African-American society wants to see in the Big Screen. We're constantly bombarded with negative, & comical depictions of our selves to see a film with respectable figures that reflect us is immensely relieving.

This story focuses on John, a man that works for the government. One day he finds himself tied to a chair in an interrogation room. He doesn't know why he's there or what they want, but he does know one thing; he's not talking. As his interrogators try to coax information out of him he fades in and out of consciousness and reminisces on his life. Will he find a way to escape? Does he even want to?

I do owe you guys an apologie, for not responding, reacting or following your blogs. It's not that i don't want to, but this project is time and energy consuming, so i don't take the time to either comment or write a simple thank you.

I've never owned a cat, but from what I've observed they do their thing and let you think you own them. They deign to grace you with their presence, and you're supposed to be grateful. And that obviously works for cats and their owners.
I just love it and I think I have found a new passion. Tranferware! I have a few pieces but definitely will keep my eye out for more to go in my collection. One thought is to make this into a lovely sink for a powder room in our new one-day home. Hubby also came home with these:
Tophatter has had a few glitches with their software...the missed alert for my customer being one of them. The other one was their server crashed on Saturday night in the middle of the weekend bazaar auction mostly due to the number of auction attendees in the room, I think. It took them about 20 minutes to reset everything and they were back in business. The staff have been very attentive to their customers...buyers and sellers alike.

I did the round twice, went back home and sat down mentally drained. The image of the envelope laying on the street under the merciless tires of fast cars haunted me. Then the other image started to haunt me, that of strangers finding the envelope and depositing the check into their personal bank accounts.
I was lunching at Gaylords (still there, and still terrific) in Fitzrovia with two contacts, and we were one of just four tables occupied. Afterwards, I strolled round the restaurant-packed area and spoke to some owners. Two admitted they didn't think they'd make it through next year unless things looked up. All said their Christmas bookings were well down before around December 15th. What seemed to be depressing most of them was the total absence of any sign of improvement.

It will charge our entire being with a presence, a force that is absolutely free of wanting. We feel open, grounded, free, humble and powerful - zero and everything. It is as through our body, heart and soul simultaneously flower in reverential awe of the moment. This force is an exquisite expression of the flower of life itself.

The rules vary from high school to high school, Uni to Uni and from State to State and even from pub to pub with paddles being used by some to hit the ball and some use quarters instead of balls.

I guess if you are using Bud for the beer, it may give the stuff some semblance of flavour.

It was a simple chance event on a London underground station that got me thinking about luck, chance and randomness and led many years later to my new novel, Wasted. It wasn't an earth-shattering event but it got me thinking. Obsessively. So, I began a novel for adults - I'd two unpublished ones languishing already - about chance, quantum mechanics, and unpredictability, involving repeated multiple possibilities. The idea was that if there is a god - which I know there isn't - he will either play dice or at least have a lot of fun observing. But halfway through, a completely different idea hit me, this time for teenagers. I abandoned god and quantum
Then I free handed the bottom black with Orly Matte Vinyl. Then I went back over that with a dotting tool. LOL wouldnt it have been impressive if I freehanded those open circles!? But I didnt. hahahah!

I'm stealing a line from a song title today-the famous "Rainy Days and Mondays" by The Carpenters, 1971. Can't you just hear the tune in your head now? If you can, then I can assure you that it's probably going to be playing in there a long time! Or at least that's what happens to me when I am reminded of a song I like-the lyrics and music dance in my brain for hours at a time before fading away, often to appear again when I am trying to fall asleep in the middle of the night. Curses! My brother calls this phenomena 'ear worms'.an image I actually don't even like to think about!

Now that I can feel that sense of "enough" in my body, and I can trust it enough to take action around it, I don't struggle nearly as much with the wants, desires, and wishes that used to plague me. I know what is enough. For most of my life, for most things in my life, I have enough. I am enough. There is enough.

While Nicholas tries to figure away to rescue Sacha's head from a life of ghoulish servitude, the Baron and Otto are down in the lab trying get their walking corpses to mate with one another. Repeatedly instructing his female zombie to kiss his male zombie, the Baron grows increasingly frustrated by the male zombie's lack of arousal after each command to "kiss him" fails to bare any erectile fruit. Unaware that Sacha's brain is not wired for sex, the Baron starts to loose it. Blaming everything from the blood they used to outside agitators, the Baron is determined to get his zombies to procreate, as it's his dream to create a race of superior beings with Serbian noses.
With Britain looking increasingly likely to secure possession of Palestine, it paved the way for the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a letter addressed to Victor's uncle, Lionel Walter Rothschild, which promised that His Majesty's government would do their utmost to establish 'a national home for the Jewish people' in Palestine. It was a 'declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations', and ultimately led to the creation of Israel. Today Balfour Day is celebrated there on November 2nd.

Something about immigration This has gotten way too emotional - if they are illegal - send them home. If they're not - then treat them as if they were citizens of the U.S.A. It's not that hard. Sure there are lots of ramifications. If you send the illegals home, it will have an impact of prices. If you don't send them home, you basically saying - It's OK to exploit them as cheap labor. If your saying make them all citizens, I'd ask who the hell is going to pay for it? And if you say - the government I'm going to smack you upside the head with a 2x4. California tried that - they're bankrupt.

04 Stagnation (Nightride, 22 February 1970)
Although Emily knows her math facts fairly well, she could stand to improve her speed, so I was interested to see how Math Rider would stack up against other programs we've tried. It teaches mastery of all 4 math operations with numbers 1-12 and is designed for children ages 6-12. To play, the child begins a "quest." A short story scenario is given, then the child rides his or her horse, "Shadow," across deserts, mountains, and so on. Math problems appear at the bottom of the screen. As the problem is answered, the horse jumps over an obstacle. If the problem is missed, the horse stops while the game gives the correct answer. The problems and speed are adjusted to the child's abilities, with problems the child has trouble with generated more frequently.

According to this reliable hadith, the cursing of a Muslim constitutes moral depravity. When any Muslim dares to curse another Muslim, this amounts to moral depravity - all the more so when it is done by a scholar, who is considered by some to be a source of authority in Islamic law. He dares to curse, to slander, to make unfounded accusations, and to sanction the killing, execution, and stoning of people. He uses black incitement against a Muslim. This is the height of moral depravity.
It reminds me of the first day he started primary school (but so much worse). He was well adjusted, happy, so ready and all smiles. I was all smiles on the outside also but came home and sobbed a million tears. A time of change and also no other littlies at home to focus on as had been my hope and dream.

WEALTHY FAMILIES: The first is wealthy families where the older generation has retired or is nearing retirement. Typically, their income is secure and they're concerned primarily with wealth protection and transfer. Agents may find that these wealthy families can take underutilized or under-performing assets and convert them to a permanent life insurance policy, often with the added advantage of a LTC rider. This strategy helps secure their wealth and makes it possible to pass on their assets to heirs in a tax-advantaged way, as well as assuring their long-term security if they need care.
This was the most recent occasion where I've discovered that my memory has improved or embellished an original. The usual trend with memory is that things fall out. In the case of movies, books, paintings and anything else remotely artistic I discover that the reverse occurs. My own aesthetic sense papers over the failings and produces a fine gloss on what might really be dross.

There was a lovely piece that they filmed with Rachel Marston who is not just wife to Andrew, daughter-in-law to the woman whose family had owned the farm for 100 years, but also mother to three children. She made it clear that farming is not easy, nor will they ever become rich, but it was obvious that she really enjoyed life on the farm, as did her children, both who want to become farmers themselves. She finished with the hope that her own children will be 'hefted' to the farm.
Our first destination, although we didn't stop was a place called Macapa which is on the northern side of the Amazon where we picked up our pilot to show us the way down the river to Santarem. Didn't see the pilot but this river is so convoluted with masses of islands and tributaries, you would get hopelessly lost, not to say run aground. They put up a special map of the river where our charts are and there are several rivers at the mouth which go on for miles and miles. Because of these islands, we passed very close to the shoreline which was littered with driftwood. The trees rose straight from the water's edge and there were big reeds and grasses. Passing us, in the river were big clumps of green, various vegetation just drifting past with brown logs bobbing up and down. Thought they were crocodiles at first. Macapa, right on the equator looks like quite a large town, houses, tall buildings and some masts showing. Little huts down at the water's edge, but didn't see many people around apart from a few who were fishing in narrow boats. A tug boat called Titan was pulling two huge rafts piled high with sand and it was hot and humid out on deck.

Here it is. The real purpose of the visit to Pho 68. Pho with rare beef and braised beef. It looked the part, and tasted it too. They've got the makings of a really good pho here. The stock was excellent. Deep, aromatic and intensely savoury. Wafer thin slices of beef were rare on arrival but cooked through as time progressed, the gentle poaching keeping them tender. The braised beef (brisket I think) was also sliced thin, but had a stronger, minerally flavour. The tendon running through it was soft and gelatinous speaking of long, slow cooking. The noodles, save for a little gluey clump at the top, were cooked just right.
Step 2 - Drop and Bake: Drop batter by tablespoon onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in a well pre-heated 350º F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Do not over-bake. Cookies should be a bit gooey in the center. While warm, they will be very soft on the outside, as well. Allow them to cool on the pan a few minutes and then transfer carefully to a rack to finish cooling. (They will always be somewhat soft because these are gooey fudge brownie cookies, not hard or crunchy cookies.)
Now that I can feel that sense of "enough" in my body, and I can trust it enough to take action around it, I don't struggle nearly as much with the wants, desires, and wishes that used to plague me.

I followed my parent's home, even though they weren't aware of my presense. My mom wept all the way while my dad remained silent. He begged my mom to calm down but it all fell on deaf ears. We got home to find the house filled with friends and relatives, my Dad carried my body and laid it on the mat in the living room. Prayers for forgiveness were said, and my parents were advised to stop crying as it wouldn't bring me back. I watched my Mom cry and weep all night as she asked God why He Had to take my life.

It will charge our entire being with a presence, a force that is absolutely free of wanting. We feel open, grounded, free, humble and powerful - zero and everything. It is as through our body, heart and soul simultaneously flower in reverential awe of the moment. This force is an exquisite expression of the flower of life itself.

I don't know.maybe nobody else feels like this about indie publishing. But this is sort of where I think I am with it. It's wonderful on so many levels - but its big flaw, I think, is that it's just too easy. Too easy to implement.too easy to mess up.too easy to get discouraged (because your frame of reference when you're solo is really quite small). Too easy, essentially, to jump in when you're green and flounder around.because you're green.

Several people have asked me for easy, healthy recipes. I'm kind of a wing-it person, so I'm always on the look-out for good websites or books to help with quick, easy cooking. I found one that's definitely a keeper. Simple Food for Busy Families: The Whole Life Nutrition Approach is a fabulous resource with step-by-step instructions on how to turn your family's bad eating habits around. The first half of the book addresses everything from getting enough sleep to why it makes sense to eat seasonal food. Each section gives practical tips on how to implement changes slowly in your family's routine so that eventually you're eating better and feeling better.

Hmm where do I start from? where? where? where.? Oh yeah, there!. So I'm quite certain that every believer knows what "New Creation" means (at least I hope so). When asked to define the term, words like "born-again", "salvation", "repentance", "baptism" etc are bound to be used in the definition. That's all good but who really is the "NEW CREATURE"? The creation story helped me understand this better so let's start from there. Once upon a time, God created man (and woman), gave him authority over everything on earth (Genesis 1:27-31) and placed him in the Garden of Eden where man could be close to HIM (GOD) all the time. One day, the enemy of God (and all God's children), satan, tricked man into sinning against God. Satan gave man "sin and the pleasures that come with it" and in return man gave up his authority over earth and everything in it, hence, man came under the rulership of satan. Uhmm.. yeah I guess you can call it an exchange. satan brought sin to man and man paid with his authority over the earth. A poor exchange indeed.but hey, it was no robbery. Anyway, satan, having all the authority now, become the ruler of man; and man the slave of satan (Jesus replied, "Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin" John 8:32). Man was forever doomed as a slave of the enemy and like anyone who is sentenced to life imprisonment without appeal, the only way of escape is DEATH. Scary huh? I know! Well, God who created man and loved man in spite of man's disobedience wanted to free His creation from bondage so He had to send no one else but LIFE to set man free. The Son of God, JESUS CHRIST is LIFE (Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the LIFE.John 14:6; "In him was LIFE.John 1:4). JESUS was/is the only ONE who can set man free.WHY? Think of it this way. Man's only hope of escaping the slavery of satan is death and we all know everyone dies but once. You have one chance to live and after that, there is death and judgement etc. God couldn't watch man die in his sins so there had to be another way to set man free and that way is JESUS. Jesus came on the earth as a man, suffered and died.but uh huh, that's the best part. He died not just for dying sake but He died so He could defeat DEATH. He had to defeat death so He could give man a second chance to life. For 3 days He was dead but on the 3rd day, He rose again having won POWER over death."..Whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have EVERLASTING life" John 3:16. Everlasting life is possible in Jesus because He holds both the power of LIFE (because He is LIFE) and DEATH(because He defeated death) in His hands. Any man who then believes in Him is set free from slavery through death but is given another chance to live and is given a NEW LIFE. Jesus creates the old slave who died anew and breathes LIFE again into his nostrils to make him a living soul.(Then the LORD God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being: Genesis 2:7). This is why anyone who is born-again/born in Christ is said to be a NEW CREATURE (Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new: 2 Corinthians 5:17). Just like the first man ever created, the NEW CREATURE is not placed back on in the world he just got freed from, he is placed into a world, a place, a kingdom where he can be close to God again. The NEW CREATURE no longer belongs to the world of sin and slavery (.because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you- John 15:19). The blessings and authority (Gen. 1:28-31) man God first gave to man before the fall is returned to the NEW CREATURE who becomes part of the body of Christ (.and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all- Ephe. 1:20-23). Yup! Not only does the NEW YOU receive freedom and salvation in CHRIST, but you also receive power and authority over satan and his followers. So now you know.The "NEW YOU" who is born in CHRIST is more powerful and more important than can be comprehended. YOU are God's own precious POSSESSION bought at a very high price. YOU are PRICELESS as could be. Turn to HIS WORD to fully know the "NEW YOU" He created.
Ok, here's where I encountered some problems. Notice how the sides of my cake are SUPER brown, whereas the top is a nice green. This is bad. It makes the sides really tough.

Author has provided details about complex procedures, requirement of mentors, strict and long training that goes into making of a Geisha. There is usual back-stabbing, politics and fights among existing and upcoming Geisha as well. It is interesting to note that in those circumstances, the best that a girl can hope for is to be chosen as Geisha. Without that status their life is that of a servant with little hope of any money or care in old age. The impact of war on society as well as the tradition of Geisha itself is very nicely told. I found the book to be quite good though some aspects of various characters can end up confusing you. I guess that is mainly due to complex Japanese customs and traditions.

I started with Indus, an IPA. It looked to be pouring a bit flat and it took a bit of coaxing to get a loose-bubbled head to form on the top. It didn't last long. However the beer really benefits from the low carbonation as it creates a wonderful cask-like effect, with just enough sparkle to push the flavours out. Naturally enough, it's hops out front: good honest English varieties by the taste of them, with lots of floral orange blossom laid on quite intensely, creating almost a resinous burn while staying clean and crisp, avoding all harshness. At 4.6% ABV it's around a percentage point weaker than the likes of White Shield and Bengal Lancer, but I'd regard it as being very much in the same league. The balance of marmalade and toffee you get in the others isn't present here, but the hop punchiness makes up for it for me. Tangy, sinkable and with a lasting bitterness, I really enjoyed it.

Alan was born in the Auvergnat town of Riom. His father Georges (Jord in Breton) Cochevelou was a civil servant in the French Ministry of Finance who achieved his dream of recreating a Celtic or Breton harp in the small town of Gourin, Brittany. In 1953, Alan began playing the instrument at the age of nine under the tutelage of his father and Denise Megevand, a concert harpist. Alan also learned Celtic mythology, art and history as well as the Breton language, traditional Breton dance and the Scottish bagpipe and the bombarde, a traditional Breton instrument, from the oboe family. Alan began playing concerts at eleven years and studying traditional Breton, English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh folk music, also learning the drum, Irish flute, and tin whistle. He competed in and won several Breton traditional music competitions in the Bleimor Pipe band. Alan spent his childhood in Paris, with its cosmopolitan influences from France, Algeria, Morocco and elsewhere. But he fell in love with Breton music and Celtic culture in general, and often went back in his teens to Brittany.

My memoir on adopting my daughter from China was perhaps the hardest thing I ever wrote mainly because at the same time that I was trying to understand what was going on, what this sudden unexpected journey in the middle of my life actually meant, to capture in words what it actually felt like- I was trying to get others to understand, to feel all of this at the same time.
My absolute worst fear in this entire world.
2. Francis Alys' Fabiola at LACMA: Archive projects are usually awful - aesthetically mute, didactic, and boring. This exhibition proved that that does not have to be the case. Human, smart, and full of wonder, it was basically everything I need from art.

I spent this past weekend at a retreat at the Seabeck Conference Center. I had to smile as I drove into Seabeck. The business district, if I don't count the Conference Center, consists of only about a half a dozen buildings, but when I arrived in town I was greeted by a small gray building with a bright blue door. White trim around the window caused the red "Espresso" sign to pop. I decided to go inside. The usual rows of flavors were lined up on a shelf; an espresso machine and a barista were visible from behind a tiny counter. Five or six wooden stools filled the remaining floor space- stools that were all occupied by the locals. They are a generous lot. I discovered that they will tease anyone. They didn't penalize me for being a visitor; locals and visitors are all teased alike.

I set a target number and gave the child that number of flies to spill onto a desktop. We started with 5 flies. I made a worksheet to record a fly addition sentence: Dead Flies + Live Flies = How Many Flies Altogether? I put the paper in a page protector so we could change the target number. The picture matches the type of flies I found, but I think you could use it with any plastic fly. As long as kids record the upright flies in one column and the upside down flies in the other column, they're good to go. I mean fly!

Apparently we aren't the only ones who are connectivity-deprived on the Island - the line to get in and get online starts at about 9 on a Tuesday morning (the library is heartlessly closed on Sunday and Monday) with people flopped about the lawn looking listless and bereft. Then the doors open promptly at 10 and everybody pours into the adorable edifice on 58 North Summer Street.

I have gone to doctors who thought it would be easy to take advantage of a broken girl. What they didn't know is that this girl may be broken, but very bad tempered as well and not scared of saying "no way" while stumbling out of the room.
The verdict? More likely to attract shoppers than Sir Can-A-Lot but a little too futuristic to be relevant in today's economy. Also, without ads it's missing a crucial selling point.

Our personal psychology is how our karmic patterns show up in this lifetime. A general Buddhist or Hindu perspective on karma suggests that the individual soul moves through consciousness lifetime after lifetime, incarnating again and again in the school of life in order to complete various tasks and lessons, and to release contractions of consciousness.
I'm sure that there are some instances where murder is justified, perhaps if your assailant has a weapon capable of terminating you or someone under your protection. Perhaps to relieve someone's intense suffering (by their own explicitly stated choice). That's it really, I can't think of any other excuses.
One thing I would be interested in doing is being diagnosed. It's been about 5 years since I last saw a psychiatrist and i guess you could technically say that the BPD diagnosis I received back then wasn't "official". He just showed me the symptoms in a book, asked me what I thought, and I said I agreed.

Yes and no. Ordinary sexuality dimly reflects the external appearance of this necklace; but in truth these women are the direct All-Attractive Energies (bhagavan-prakti), the divine goddesses, eternal manifestations of the fullness of the Absolute All-Attractive Being.

Every time the subject of marriage comes up, I have to shake my head at the single girls I know. Some of them are younger than I am, some of them are my age, some older. They all want that holy grail of dating and relationships - a husband. It's like some crowning achievement. An end game. Life would only be complete if I had a husband.
I attended the opening night of "Greener" in The Gaiety Theatre last night. I'm always worried about going to comedies. I recall literally wanting to run out of "Run for your wife" in the same theatre many years ago. I like comedy to be intelligent and challenging, making you laugh by pointing out the ridiculousness of life and love, and the frailty and wonder of the human condition, rather than a series of obvious one-liners. I need not have worried. From the moment the four main characters commanded the stage, the atmosphere was electric and the tremendous script carried them along admirably.

For to long to mention there have been a few hair accessories that needed some attention. They have been sitting on the kitchen counter being moved from one spot to the next.

And how much does scrumpy sell for at the farm gate in the West Country nowadays? Indeed, does the farmer even know how strong it is? If it's 8%, a pint will cost £1.82, which I suspect is rather more than the current price.
What ought to be acutely troubling is that the history of revisions to oil and gas resources has heretofore been one of increases. For the first time, we are now seeing not just downward revisions in estimated natural gas resources, but drastic downward revisions. That should tell us that the era of unlimited horizons for fossil fuels has come to a close. All the advanced technology that was supposed to bring unending plenty in the form of fossil fuels is now giving us better estimates of what will be available, namely, not nearly so much as we thought.

A journal is also something that you can use to comfort your feelings when you are ashamed to do so any other way. You may want to make sure that you are including everything that has happened since your divorce started. You can make sure that you are keeping track of the daily things that make you sad or things that you do to make yourself feel better. As you are writing you will see that your true emotions are coming out and that you are finally able to make some head way on rebuilding your life for the better.
Of course, as with all of John Waters' early films, it's the gorgeous Mink Stole who shines the brightest. Playing Dawn's fourteen year old daughter, Taffy Davenport, the sexy Mink repeatedly makes Meryl Streep look like a dishevelled whore through her unblinking industriousness.
"And there is no need to withdraw welfare allowances to OKU (handicapped persons)," he said, referring to the uproar caused by Assistant Minister for Agriculture (Research and Marketing) Mong Dagang who revoked the welfare aid to Frusis Lebi, a disabled farmer because of his open support for the opposition.

A few pictures from our day...
While we're there we load up on still warm, fresh bagels and coffee. I also grabbed a Superfood drink for later. Now if you're not familiar with this, it's a fruit juice and Spirulina blend with several other goodies mixed in just for fun and giggles. It tastes great but looks kind of like pond scum, (i.e. thick and dark green) It tends to make people go "yuck" just by looking at it and phrases like, "you're not really going to drink that are you?" are common. To tell you the truth I think that's really why I like it. Armed with all the essentials, it's out to the car. Putting the bagels and juice behind the front seat we are now ready for our big adventure.
If I don't chase my dreams, I'll go nowhere. If I do chase the dreams, then I might fall, but here's something else to remember: It's not only about the destination. The true joy is in the journey.

We all know our mistakes and we're well aware of all the obvious ways we mess up and keep messing up. It's also one of the many reasons, we avoid God. Too many people think of God as the Judge of the Universe and feel unworthy to pray, step foot in a church, and hate the feeling of condemnation they feel when comparing themselves to what they ought to be doing.
So that's the excitement for today.

The other concern the WEF report raised was the short-term increase in carbon dioxide projected for Germany which, with today's global warming problems, cannot be taken lightly. The report say that "carbon emissions will also rise, with an increase of between 170 million and 400 million tonnes of carbon dioxide between 2011 and 2020, as Germany turns to coal and gas plants to replace nuclear generation in the short-term."
Exciting, exciting... can you believe its JUNE?! That means, to me, its summer. I feel like every month I say, "can you believe its January, May, etc?" But seriously, June is big for me. It means I've been graduated for over 1 year?!?
I guess I'll start with the name in the address bar. For a while now (at least ten years) I've been working on a fantasy series that has recently become more serious to me. One of the main plot devices is a dream world. So, when I went to use the restroom at a truckstop one day and saw this written on the inside of one of the stalls in permanent marker, I knew I had to incorporate it into my story. Now I have a character who manufactures dreams and I am one step closer to getting this story off the ground.
I wonder who made it all rhyme though? Did they brief the MC?
Having a good reputation is something you want in the music business. It sounds like obvious good advice for artists to tell them to be able to play well with others, but this also needs to include others you might not like or want to play with. In todays music business, you may come across and have to work with people you don't like, they might be doing things you cant stand, but bashing them excessively online or around others is not going to help you get what you want in the end.

The biggest emotion, though, is probably regret. Even though I was at the hospital several different times the week before he died, I never found the courage to really talk to him, to tell him that I forgave him for all the bad stuff. For the most part, I put all that behind me a long time ago, and focused on remembering the good times, the memories that can still make me smile. And that man is the one I miss, the man I wish was still here for Amy, to walk her down the aisle, to spoil our grandchildren, to sing to them.....
I first saw this H&M snake-embossed envelope clutch weeks ago at a location in the city, fell in love (who would've thought since I hate snakes?!), but passed because I didn't have my 20% coupon with me. Days later, when I was ready to actually buy, I couldn't find it anywhere in the stores near me. This is what I get for wanting to save $4 lol. I was about to give up when I recently revisited one of the stores and saw they had restocked. Hallelujah!

A pipe dream, I know, as so many see the wheels as an extension of their existence.

Mendy, as much as I, found this almost too good to be true and a bit hard to believe, even though all sorts of wonderful beings show up in her office all the time. As she said later, though, she has a great deal of experience with this stuff and she feels confident of being able to sniff out a fraud. Stephen did not appear to be a fraud, not to either of us. I had a feeling of the sublime, no sense of anything that might raise an alarm.
Tens of thousands of mainly Shiites took to the streets in Bahrain in February and March demanding political reform and better rights, with some calling for the downfall of the Al Khalifa monarchy. The uprising was brutally crushed by the regime and thousands were arrested and sacked from public and private sector jobs.
The Bush Conspiracy Theory is a Lie. If neither flight was in the air as American Airlines itself has so stated, then numerous 'official versions' of the 'official conspiracy theory' are but a pack of malicious lies. There is, then, probable cause to indict Bush and his co-conspirators for the crimes of mass murder and high treason. See: U. S. Codes, Title 18, Section 2441. That includes every statement made by Bush.

Everyone is putting a positive spin on the game for the MLS with such a huge crowd. Well, as long as we keep playing Man U, you will surly have 70K a game. For some reason the Dynamo can't even get a big crowd when we play those Mexican squads. Not sure what's going on here, but hopefully the new stadium downtown will do the trick.
I have recently become aware of a theory that suggests as we move closer towards 21st December 2012, Earth's timelines converge and we essentially get down to only two timelines. Timeline 1 which is positive and results in the New World/Golden Age and timeline 2 which results in the New World Order controlling this planet. We are apparently on timeline 1. Can the Nine shed any light on this theory?

Here it is. The real purpose of the visit to Pho 68. Pho with rare beef and braised beef. It looked the part, and tasted it too. They've got the makings of a really good pho here. The stock was excellent. Deep, aromatic and intensely savoury. Wafer thin slices of beef were rare on arrival but cooked through as time progressed, the gentle poaching keeping them tender. The braised beef (brisket I think) was also sliced thin, but had a stronger, minerally flavour. The tendon running through it was soft and gelatinous speaking of long, slow cooking. The noodles, save for a little gluey clump at the top, were cooked just right.
After all, this is no ordinary "comeback". This is a man that was among the best high school sprinters/hurdlers in the country (10.36/13.66) when he graduated in 2000 (= #4 in both events). He then went to the University of Tennessee where he won back to back NCAA sprint doubles as a frosh/soph and set a National Collegiate Record for 200 meters (19.86). He then went pro and following injury in his first pro season came back to win the Olympic 100 meter title in Athens (9.85) and then a sprint double in Helsinki (9.88/20.00) in very inclement weather. The follow up was an equaling of the then WR of 9.77 for 100 meters early the next season.

Then I noticed, the refrigerator is on the fritz, yet again. It's turned up to nine and just barely keeping things cool. The repair man kept saying he was coming. Until the manager called him again at 6pm and he said, tomorrow. The manager said, and in the meantime their food is going bad.

Our first destination, although we didn't stop was a place called Macapa which is on the northern side of the Amazon where we picked up our pilot to show us the way down the river to Santarem. Didn't see the pilot but this river is so convoluted with masses of islands and tributaries, you would get hopelessly lost, not to say run aground. They put up a special map of the river where our charts are and there are several rivers at the mouth which go on for miles and miles. Because of these islands, we passed very close to the shoreline which was littered with driftwood. The trees rose straight from the water's edge and there were big reeds and grasses. Passing us, in the river were big clumps of green, various vegetation just drifting past with brown logs bobbing up and down. Thought they were crocodiles at first. Macapa, right on the equator looks like quite a large town, houses, tall buildings and some masts showing. Little huts down at the water's edge, but didn't see many people around apart from a few who were fishing in narrow boats. A tug boat called Titan was pulling two huge rafts piled high with sand and it was hot and humid out on deck.
The day of the big dance, the twins are instructed to clean their rooms and while doing so, Elizabeth discovers George's letter to Enid. Using her mad Jessica Fletcher skillz, she finally deducts that it was her unhinged sister that told Ronnie about George. Of course, instead of confronting her like a normal person, Elizabeth begins to plot her revenge. Seeing as the last book established her unique brand of crap vengeance, she's probably just planning to hide Jessica's hairbrush or something.

Yet let us analyze these implications in their general form. Starting with an increase in extreme weather, the erosion of soils and weak rock will increase. This will cause more of the imposing landmasses to crumble into the sea leading to an even greater rise in sea level. The changes will exponentially become more and more unpredictable. A chaotic patter will emerge which can never be studied. People will panic, but the plain fact is that nature is beyond their control. Sea levels will rise, temperatures will spike, and weather will be out of control. Everything will seem to be pointing toward an inevitable apocalypse.

This is a unique album, wedged between the previous 'Glam-esque' releases (although to be fair, Big Beat was starting to head towards a more American sound), and prior to their full blown move to the Euro Electronic sound. By the mid 70's, Sparks were pretty big all over Europe (particularly in Britain), and the band were keen to make inroads in their own backyard, so this album was to take on the US market - even the title seems geared to their prospective new audience, although knowing their wicked sense of humour, it was more likely just a piss take title for their seventh album! I asked Russell and Ron to spill the beans on how they ended up with it, they told me "We just felt it a propos to title our 7th album Introducing Sparks. Most bands don't name their 7th album 'introducing'. That's probably what appealed to us. In fact, most bands don't even have a 7th album!".

So I pondered and scratched out various possibilities, and casually read through various texts by and about Che or Abe, wondering what the most suggestive, poetic and concise way of connecting these two men across time and history could be, until one day I hit on something that I just knew was right. It was a quote, by Che, in reference to his trip to New York City in 1964 to address the United Nations' General Assembly. It seems that while he was in New York there were two attempts on his life, one by a man wielding a gun and one by a woman with a knife. When asked about these attacks by a journalist, he is said to have responded with a smile and a bemused wisecrack: "It is better to be killed by a woman with a knife than a man with a gun" said Che.

When I was young, my aunt and uncle would take me "antiquing" with them and we would find an assortment of treasures along the way. I loved finding something cool that had been discarded. I'm a firm believe in "one man's trash is another man's treasure." Recently, a friend borrowed our trailer to remove some old junk from his basement. I had the opportunity to do a little digging through his "trash" on the hunt for some treasures. Of course, I had this challenge in mind and I was so hoping to find something I could use. I was not to be disappointed! In fact, you'll see a few more items I found over the course of this month.

Reaching goals requires motivation. ZenHabits does a nice job of explaining motivation, as well as ways to achieve it and sustain it during times of struggle. To find out more about motivation, check out the self-motivation quiz from Mindtools. After the quiz, there is a nice explanation of factors involved in self-motivation including: self-confidence and efficacy, positive thinking, focus, and environment. The author from the article How Self-Motivated Are You noted, "Self-motivation doesn't come naturally to everyone. And even those who are highly self-motivated need some extra help every now and then. Build your self-motivation by practicing goal-setting skills, and combining those with positive thinking, the creation of powerful visions of success, and the building of high levels of self-efficacy and self-confidence."

We divied up the three mags among those of us without a closet full of porn hidden at home. My brother found mine and absconded with it within the week which probably saved me trouble later down the road.
So when Atlanta's premier Master of the Dead calls to ask for help with a vampire on the loose, Kate leaps at the chance of some paying work. Turns out this is not an isolated incident, and Kate needs to get to the bottom of it-fast, or the city and everyone dear to her might pay the ultimate price.
For those tasks that could very well carry you through the night, you need to realise that somethings are better left for the next day if they are beyond reasonable to accomplish today. You will normally find that doing so will produce a better result anyway as you will be better focused and will have had time to re-energise.

There was a problem, though, in that, when they were attempting to insert a guide wire-thing into her esophagus, they popped a hole in her LARYNX. So, they had to take out all their guides and scopes and instruments while the doctor consulted with another laparoscopic doctor and an ENT to decide if this was a big deal. Apparently, it should heal on its own, provided there isn't any infection, so they just sewed up the hole, put everything back in, and finished the operation; hence, FIVE AND A HALF HOUR surgery.

I wanted to like The Final Countdown a lot more than I did. This is one script, however, that ends up just as a drama, with a couple of intriguing scenes involving aerial recon pictures and historic pictures, and another scene where that captured Japanese pilot suddenly realizes what is going on. It was so close, so often. And the very last scene with the black limo WAS clever, but you expect that at the end of an episode of "Twilight Zone". You expect MORE from all this and World War II.

Besides, isn't state-ism itself a religion for most Americans? Do they not honor the state above all else, above even the commandments of a conventional religion they may embrace? If their religion tells them "thou shalt not murder," but the state orders them to murder, then they murder. If the state tells them to rob, to destroy property, and to imprison innocent people, then, notwithstanding any religious strictures, they rob, destroy property, and imprison innocent people, as millions of victims of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and millions of victims of the so-called Drug War in this country will attest. Moreover, in every form of adversity, Americans look to the state for their personal salvation, just as before the twentieth century their ancestors looked to Divine Providence.

In any case, Cameron is looking thoroughly decent, if a bit foppish, on social issues. One could even consider voting for him (if one lived in Whitney), except for the fact that he is utterly, unforgivably, wrong on the economy.
Last week saw another turn of direction for the brand with the news that the Genii Capital-owned F1 team has terminated its sponsorship agreement with Group Lotus. Financial uncertainty has surrounded Group Lotus since the investment arm of the Malaysian Government, Khazanah, selling its near on 43 percent stake in Lotus parent company Proton, to another Malaysian entity, DRB-Hicom. Those famous insiders surfaced in various reports saying that the sale of Proton was a contributing reason for Genii cancelling its sponsorship agreement.

But going down through the water to touch the wild man at the bottom of the pond is quite a different matter. The being who stands up is frightening, and he seems even more so now, when corporations do so much work to produce the sanitized, hairless shallow man (2) That's poor Viggo in THE ROAD, a sanitized man re-bearded, trying to be wild in a wild land, having to re-learn the role of the deep, dark masculine and getting it incorrect. No reflection on Viggo, of course, who showed he can bring that shit hardcore in the RINGS films and HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. It's more I think the head-on craftsmanshippy approach to the McCarthy novel -- it gets it too right, maybe, to work. Teardrop on the other hand is the untamed wild man, the kind of guy that creeps you out at first but then somewhere along the way, not sure when, you start to admire him. Isn't that so much better, children, than the other way around? (Beards of Bleakness: WINTER'S BONE VS. THE ROAD)
I learned about Oh My Melodies from Espousal Records' Kyoungmo Kim as he updated me on the current whereabouts of the members of emo pop band I Love JH.

Jupiter owns Pisces, and the Moon owns Cancer. This is another reason why Cancer is an even better place for Jupiter than Pisces. Huh? That sounds backwards? No, there is a very important lesson to learn here! You may be as great as a planet, but you never achieve your zenith of potential except in partnership with other people. It is in cooperation with the energies of other people that we can rise to greater heights than we can on our own. And this is yet another factor making Cancer, not Pisces, the exaltation sign of Jupiter.

SkyWest's total operating revenues increased $55.2 million, or 6.4%, during the quarter ended March 31, 2012, over the same period in 2011. The increase in operating revenues was the result of higher pass-through costs (primarily fuel and engine overhaul costs) under SkyWest's agreements with its major partners and an increase in block hour production. The increase in operating revenues was offset by a planned reduction in prorate flying block hours of 13.4% resulting in reduced revenues of approximately $6.0 million. In spite of the reducing operating revenues from prorate flying, SkyWest's revenue per available seat mile for this flying increased 14.6% from improved pricing. After excluding the increased pass-through costs of approximately $31.1 million, for fuel and engine overhauls, and the reduction in prorate flying revenue of $6.0, total operating revenues increased approximately $30.1 million due to the additional block hour production of 3.1% and improved utilization. Total block hours for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 were 556,421 compared to 539,910 for the same period last year.

"The Wallflower" rose to No. 2 on the rhythm-and-blues charts in 1954. As was often the case in those days with records by black performers, a toned-down version was soon recorded by a white singer and found a wider audience: Georgia Gibbs's version, with the title and lyric changed to "Dance With Me, Henry," was a No. 1 pop hit in 1955. (Its success was not entirely bad news for Ms. James. She shared the songwriting royalties with Mr. Ballard and the bandleader and talent scout Johnny Otis, who had arranged for her recording session. (Mr. Otis died on Tuesday.)

3. (C) After thanking PM Meles for the meeting and noting the positive U.S.-Ethiopian relationship, Sen. Feingold asked the PM about Ethiopian plans for dealing with Somalia. Meles replied that the situation in Somalia had deteriorated significantly in the last six months. Like the Taliban in Afghanistan, the CIC had filled a political vacuum in Somalia, providing security and stability in areas that they controlled. Meles said the CIC was also riding a wave of resurgent Jihadism in the region which had been encouraged by developments in Iraq and Afghanistan. He noted that the CIC had been implementing the same brand of radical Islam espoused by other extremists, as was evidenced by their censoring of television programming and cinemas, as well as their ban on khat. Meles acknowledged that Somalis had traditionally resisted such extreme interpretations of Islam, but also remarked that Somalis "liked to back a winning horse" and Jihadists had accumulated a string of victories that was winning converts to their cause. This gathering military momentum had allowed a relatively small group of extremists to dominate the large and diverse organizations who formed the CIC. Meles said CIC leaders Sheik Aweys, Aidan Ayro and Hassan al-Turki had direct connections to Al Qaeda that were known to intelligence services, including in the U.S. He agreed with Sen. Feingold's suggestion that the CIC could be considered a "franchise of Al Qaeda."

Next, write down all the skills you need to learn or to work on. If you are just getting started with writing, you may find this difficult. If people have made comments on your writing, you can use those comments to make your list. If, for instance, you have been told that your characters are not believable or your descriptions fuzzy, then the skills of creating characters and writing description go on your list. Or try this: read over a piece of writing by your favorite author, writing you consider excellent. Now write down all the things the writer does that make this piece so good. How many of these things can you do now? How many of them do you need to learn how to do?

First of all, for those who don't know I have 3 adopted siblings. They are all from the Philippines. Actually there are six kids in my family and our order goes a bit like this - biological, adopted, biological, adopted, biological, adopted. :) My parents were also foster parents for about 8 years, so we had infants in and out of our house - most in which (I think) were adopted. So as you can tell adoption has been a pretty big part of my life. I always knew I wanted to adopt. It just seemed like something I was suppose to do when having a family. My husband's family is a bit different from mine - he's the only one! Although we came from different types of families, we both knew we wanted to have a family eventually.

Having a good reputation is something you want in the music business. It sounds like obvious good advice for artists to tell them to be able to play well with others, but this also needs to include others you might not like or want to play with. In todays music business, you may come across and have to work with people you don't like, they might be doing things you cant stand, but bashing them excessively online or around others is not going to help you get what you want in the end.
On that subject, can I take this opportunity to thank you all for your support and kind messages throughout the year.

I think it's safe to say that we didn't really learn anything. SJSU was clearly out manned and Alabama was never really tested. CJ Mosely looks like he's got some talent and McCarron did a pretty decent job as well. So, in that regard I guess we learned that we have some talent in reserve, but I think we were all pretty clear on that anyway. Let's all agree that the Spartans amounted to a pre-season scrimmage game that actually counts on the record.

The new characters were incredibly underdeveloped; Angelica, Blackbeard, the Minister, and the mermaid all felt forced upon the audience as if we were suppose to enjoy them, but realistically they were just annoying. Angelica is mad at Jack for taking her virginity (wasn't pirates suppose to be geared for Children?) Blackbeard hides in his cabin for most of the film (wasn't he the scariest pirates of all time?) the Minister falls in love with the mermaid (who in this film can shoot spiderwebs from their wrists like Spider-Man) just because he sees her naked (again, Disney, Pirates, Children?) and the Mermaid needs to shed one tear (there were enough tears of pain from the audience to solve that problem).

Thus, no doubt soon you will probly hear soon some business leaders or pretend potential self-appointed communist leaders lamenting the lack of organization of the #Occupy movements, describing them as "in choate" (which is a kind of wide penis with no head), or "udderless," or "lacking discernible goals" (like Sporting Gijon). What they are really mean is that there is a ferment of new ideas that therefore could be dangerous and must be curtailed, or at least curtopped. After all, nobody has any idea where a march that goes nowhere might end up. If these peoples weren't too feckless to emigrate we could at least lure them onto a ferry with the promise of jobs in Australia and transport them there. We would never hear of them ever again! But while they are there, in the midst of ordinary, heads-down, knees-back God-fearing punters, fermenting theories without limitations and trying out new processes, such as democracy-never a positive development-they constitute a threat to our docile, passive, obedient way of life. They must be stomped on by square-headed baton-wielding riot police, preferably from up the country, before any new ideas seep out into the public body at large, like a ball of ideological pus.
You are transformed into a world where rolling hills, sprawling vineyards, beautiful houses, and quaint villages take over. From lunch with a traditional Italian family to cooking pasta, visiting shops selling ham, cured meats and cheese, tasting wines and visiting a local factory making pasta, Antonio and Gennaro keeps you entertained with their wit and humour in Bologna- their first stop. Next they move on to the South of Italy to the Amalfi coast, where Gennaro grew up. Personally this was the most favourite episode for me. Cooking by the sea side, plucking fresh lemons off the trees and biting into them, preparing a linguine dish on a boat using fresh octopus and mussels which Gennaro collected after his diving expedition and the wit and humour the two Italians share among themselves were absolutely fun to watch. Ah! the ricotta and lemon tart they made in this episode still holds fresh in my memory. Its high up there on my to-make list.

If you are a woman, and you hold Friedrich Nietzsche in high esteem as one of the great enlightened thinkers of modern philosophy, there is a decent chance you might be unfamiliar with the full extent of the man's musings about the fairer sex. Since his own lifetime, the philosopher has been accused of promoting misogynistic ideas in his writings, due to his tendency of abrasively referring to women-and femininity as a whole-in largely hostile terms (as we shall explore shortly). However, it should be stated for the sake of objectivity, that this sentiment is not universally accepted amongst prominent female authors and thinkers, as some of these individuals interpret Nietzsche's apparently sexist aphorisms as a rhetorical strategy, used to illustrate the vain construct men have of women, and the potential to possibly move beyond this simplistic sentiment.[1] Whether any of these more favorable interpretations are viable positions in light of Nietzsche's own words, or simply attempts to exonerate the philosopher of the charge of misogyny, is the focus of the analysis that follows below. Although Nietzsche never wrote a single cumulative work on the topic of womanhood, his books are nevertheless filled with countless critiques and examinations of the female psych, thereby making it possible for the reader to gather a coherent impression of the philosopher's views on women, and gender relations in general.

Kaputt is a total curveball from an artist who had previously been in danger of settling too comfortably into a familiar style. Dan Bejar's albums as Destroyer had been yielding diminishing returns in recent years, and it had begun to seem like he was going to keep mining the same basic territory until everyone who once loved his quirky, urbane, complex pop grew bored of the stagnation. Instead, he's turned to an out-of-favor style from the past, swathing his songs in reverb-heavy lite-jazz and balearic pop atmospheres, recalling the crude synth presets and shimmering, plastic production of early 80s radio pop. It's a daring reinvention, and what initially might seem like a gimmick soon reveals itself, over multiple listens, as a brilliant aesthetic maneuver. Bejar's usually spiky voice is smoothed out to fit the glistening musical backdrops, and the album glides by so effortlessly that Bejar's characteristic wit has a chance to sneak up on the listener for once. The music is sad and sweet, and there's a lonely nostalgic feeling built into Bejar's trip to the musical past. Horns echo within the mix, surrounded with reverb to impart a feeling of distance, as though the trumpeter is miles away, intoning lonely notes into a void. Bejar is taking music often thought of as kitschy and dated and reconstructing it as haunting downer pop, revealing the loneliness and emptiness lurking behind the party gloss and disco gleam. Because of the subtlety of it all, and the initial impression of surface slickness, it's a real grower of an album that only parcels out its secrets slowly, gradually accumulating emotional depth and intensity until the kitschy surface style seems like the most natural possible way of capturing these dark, secret feelings.

I've been dating a little bit, and its been fun. Both men and women. There is one very pretty grrrrr in Ellensburg but it seems like we are both gravitating in different directions. I've found someone that I think I really like, and I'm a little surprised because it is not someone that would ever catch my eye...I mean, the kind of person that you go by in the grocery store and don't even notice. But once you make yourself look, well, his heart is like a kaleidoscope of radiant gems and syrups. My own juices are flowing with the bright heat of summer, and love is floating with the fuzzy cotton tree seeds in the wind.
I don't know.maybe nobody else feels like this about indie publishing. But this is sort of where I think I am with it. It's wonderful on so many levels - but its big flaw, I think, is that it's just too easy. Too easy to implement.too easy to mess up.too easy to get discouraged (because your frame of reference when you're solo is really quite small). Too easy, essentially, to jump in when you're green and flounder around.because you're green.

Despite the horrid waste of taxpayer's money on the various green energy firms that keep failing, Obama blamed the Solyndra debacle on the Chinese who "were subsidizing their solar industry and flooding the market in ways that Solyndra couldn't compete." That was well known before the Solyndra half billion dollar loan guarantee was made, followed by still more to other solar companies.

Admiral Ororod did not garner the complete respect of those under him; he had connections, came from a well-to-do family with important political ties, more a bureaucrat with aspirations for a political career than a military career, he ran his detachment more like a business than the military unit it was. He may have been far from the most inspirational of fleet officers, but his politically minded motivations also helped to ensure that the Orion was one of the top training vessels in all the fleet.

2. Bring an Abundance of Water and Food on Hikes: The rule of thumb when hiking is: when half of your water supply is gone, start heading back. Last summer I hiked Upper Yosemite Falls, one of the oldest trails in Yosemite, and leads to the highest waterfall in North America at 2,425 ft. It took me 3 hours to hike up and I tried to conserve my water as much as possible but unfortunately I was not able to. Fortunately, when I finally got to the top there was a benevolent man who was filtering water, from the waterfall, to give to weary hikers. Make sure to bring snacks that are high in protein and carbohydrates such as granola bars and nuts because when the hike says strenuous, it means it!

It was VERY HARD for me to STOP buying fabric. I kept telling myself, "Ooooh! Wouldn't this be cute? I have to have a bit of this!" I actually used over 150+ fabrics in this quilt. I hope you have fun playing with your stash and adding the newest cutest fabrics to your quilt.

But The Phantom, it seems, has been histroically overshadowed by the truly staggering popular reception that greeted the debut of Superman, and his equally colourful cohorts (such as Batman, Captain America, et al), from the 1940s onwards. Perhaps he simply wasn't "super" enough to stand out amongst the growing throngs of super-powered crime-fighters that crowded American comic-books for the duration of World War II. Even as costumed superheroes reasserted their status (after a decade-long hiatus) as the dominant American comic-book genre throughout the 1960s, The Phantom remained a secondary character, despite earning his first self-titled American comic-book series in 1962.

As voters in NC will be deciding the fate of Amendment One, let's take a look at the ten most compelling secular legislative reasons to vote in favor of the amendment:
Yesterday was my birthday! I absolutely love birthdays. I don't really know why - presents make me awkward, I don't usually throw big bashes. but maybe it is something around the fact that you can't help but reflect on how far you've come in a year and to celebrate it. After all, when one 'turns' 24, you're actually concluding your 24th year of life, it only makes sense to celebrate it. But, it is also exciting to think about how much could change in the coming year and to imagine where I might be when I have my next birthday. Right now, all possibilities seem little more than a few flicks of the wrist to make a reality by February 6, 2013. I'm unbelievably excited for what my 25th year will bring.
This story focuses on John, a man that works for the government. One day he finds himself tied to a chair in an interrogation room. He doesn't know why he's there or what they want, but he does know one thing; he's not talking. As his interrogators try to coax information out of him he fades in and out of consciousness and reminisces on his life. Will he find a way to escape? Does he even want to?

The story revolves around Vyme a mechanic at the star pit where ships are repaired. He tries to help out young people that want to work in the repair shops. One is Ratit. It seems Vyme misses his own group family and his kids. He has a drinking problem and that alienated him from everyone.
As we approached Shoreditch, I spotted this building. I couldn't see a date on it but it looks Victorian. A deliciously extravagant design, this pub was once called Ye Olde Axe but the name has been painted over and the swinging sign has all but lost its paintwork. The building looks neglected and in need of repair, like something out of a Gothic horror film. An illuminated sign on the side reads "Striptease". Unsurprisingly, the clock no longer works. It is very sad to see buildings like this being allowed to fall into a state of neglected disrepair.
Before I get lost in embarrassingly worshipful paeans about the pieces on Axl Rose ("with the wasp-man sunglasses and the braids and the goatee, he reminds one of the monster in Predator, or of that monster's wife on its home planet") and Michael Jackson ("a god moves through him; the god enters, the god leaves") and the rest, let me stop and explain.

Singer Dionne Warwick showed that the way to San Jose isn't the only thing she's not familiar with, as she pawed in bewilderment at the cash register. Actress and deaf person Marlee Matlin conveniently forgot a lifetime of lip-reading so she could have a sign-language interpreter serve as a go-between in case anyone was tempted to yell at her. Supermodel Niki Taylor tossed pizza dough into the air, actually catching it on the way down a few times.

The Internet has also become a really cheap vehicle for delivering information. For the last twenty years many companies (dare I say, most?) have turned to the web as their primary means of communication with consumers. Still working with the old school, one-size-fits-all mentality and a general lack of understanding of how to use this new technology, these companies posted a lot of really bad, really complicated information. Because it is so cheap to distribute information on the web, it has typically been excusable to distribute information that is minimally effective. Often companies lack the understanding to even assess that their content is simply not helping. But hey! They had a website, right?

I realise that this could upset some residents of the 20th arrondisement but I've never been good at keeping foodie secrets. Saturday night I dined at Cyclo, a tiny Vietnamese restaurant on rue de Belleville, and soon discovered why it's one of the neighbourhood's best kept secrets. The place was full to the brim, with most of the patrons on a first-name basis with the owner - a charmingly flamboyant Vietnamese native who takes the utmost pride in each dish that comes out of his kitchen.

That the lives of these old fellows we see on television, and whose names we now know, go back more than a century, touches us - and it may add to the power they project for us that they are not especially heroic and do not represent themselves that way. That they do not posture or make use of any of the rhetorical cliches, but are modest survivors of the ordinary circumstances and perils of living. And that on television, where glamorisation is almost a given, so that any claim they might once have had to youthful beauty is simply irrelevant. Very young people, I suspect, who find themselves living in a dangerous and chaotic world, and with their own lives fearfully before them, feel a special affection for these old fellows who have indestructibily battled through - and even a small sense of reassurance ...

I do owe you guys an apologie, for not responding, reacting or following your blogs. It's not that i don't want to, but this project is time and energy consuming, so i don't take the time to either comment or write a simple thank you. So i take the opportunity now to tell you, that it's highly appreciated that you follow my blog and read about a project like this.and actually liking it :-p
Even more importantly I think I'm having a rebirth of my spirit. For the longest time I've basically just existed. I've done the bare minimum around the house. It's been a struggle to get that done too. But the last few weeks I've been WANTING to spread my wings and take the time to make the homemade breads and the homemade snacks. I've been wanting to do that stuff. It's almost like I'm being reborn. I don't know what has brought this about. I'm afraid to blink...afraid that it will go away if I do. I still have all the stress and depression in my life....but I'm really trying to not let it affect ME. And maybe that's the whole difference.

Watching my children and the aspirations that they have got me thinking. When do children stop aspiring to be heros? Ask any boy what he wants to be when he grows up and you're likely to be answered with things like firefighter, police officer, super hero, doctor. I've yet to meet a child who dreamed of being an accountant, lawyer, or sanitation engineer(though to be fair, my kids get really excited when the garbage truck comes rolling past our house). There is nothing wrong with any of the professions I've just mentioned, and I think they're all equally important. Perhaps we feel as we grow older that if we can't be super heros, then why bother trying? That, and being a super hero isn't a real job. A number of people are quite keen to pitch in around the community, or help someone on the side of the highway with a flat tire. We generally stop actively looking for people to help though.
The past week has been difficult. The Lord asked us to pray seriously about something that is so scary to us. Satan has definetly been on the attack and we are just asking God to send us clarity. I didn't think that I was so stressed out until the entire last week I have been waking in the middle of the night/early morning and can't sleep. Nothing like good 'ol insomnia to make you say Lord what are you trying to tell me. Thank God last night I was finally able to get some sleep. I know God is taking us on a long journey and I know I am not patient but I know God has told me to be still and wait!

That's it. There aren't really any short cuts. People always want short cuts. New acts often want to know how to get an agent. The chances are that any act asking how to get an agent doesn't really need an agent. And when they're at a stage where an agent can help them, they'll find there are agents there offering to help. That's how it works.

The story line is straightforward and simple and the newlyweds in real life Riteish Deshmukh and Genelia D'Souza do form an endearing pair on screen as well. Genelia scores simply by underplaying her ebullience. Well suited for the role of the gutsy, bindaas female lead requirement, she has successfully overcome the temptation to display her teeth in every scene of the movie. It may still require her more time and effort to match the histrionics of what Kareena Kapoor managed to achieve in the portrayal of a similar character in JAB WE MET, but if she works on her dialogue delivery and attempting more changes to her facial expressions depending on the requirement of the scene, she will certainly leave a mark.
Having a good reputation is something you want in the music business. It sounds like obvious good advice for artists to tell them to be able to play well with others, but this also needs to include others you might not like or want to play with. In todays music business, you may come across and have to work with people you don't like, they might be doing things you cant stand, but bashing them excessively online or around others is not going to help you get what you want in the end.

Friday night we had dinner at Renaldi's on Lincoln, which was perfectly kid friendly and easy! After dinner we went back to Courtney's house for wine and bonding. Courtney has an adorable new apartment in Lincoln Park were the group stayed for the weekend. Sean, Ellie, and John spent some time watching the old Muppet Movie-- getting ready for the new one out this week. We can't wait to see the muppets back on the big screen again!
I went to the front desk and explained what happened and luckily they did give us a room (it would have been a long trip home!). We got the same type of room, same rate, but it was a handicapped accessible room. They probably hold those rooms back in case they are needed. I don't know yet if I got charged for our missed night. I had reserved the room with a card that I subsequently canceled (due to fraud). So I don't know if they would have been able to charge it or not.
The bike training that the children are doing came next, Herr B couldn't resist the opportunity to comment that some of the bikes (that'll be 2 English kids then at least) don't have kick down bike stands and have to be leant up against the wall, damn!

I refuse as a matter of principle to put a bike stand on Jas's bike (sorry Jas) and if next year when the local cop in charge of bike testing doesn't pass the bike because of it's lack of a stand then so be it, to date there's no legal requirement for bikes to have stands to make them roadworthy therefore our bikes will be standless and I shall stand my ground on that one.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the apple cider vinegar, balsamic vinegar, maple syrup, ketchup, red onion, garlic and chile. Stir and let simmer, uncovered, for about an hour. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook for 15 more minutes until the sauce thickens. Stir it often. If it seems too thick, add some water.

The Kingdom of God starts small, a grain of wheat, a mustard seed, a leaven in the loaf. And it spreads, oh, yes, it grows. But it starts small, even hidden in the secret places, a knitting together of wonder, perhaps.

Let's examine the second half of the video. One protester calls out 'Mic check!,' and everyone knows what this means. This guy will speak for us, he has something to say. And if they disagree, they can simply stop passing this person's words along. But in this case he speaks words of de-escalation. We will let you police leave. He's teaching the police a lesson in non-violence. It's amazing to see this at work.
Covey amplifies his message by means of wide-ranging examples of "third alternative thinkers". There's the local police force that transformed a crime-plagued community by casting off its entrenched "them against us" mentality. Another example tells the tale of a father who, during the course of one extraordinary evening, rescued his daughter from years of clinical depression. Then there's the judge who brought a swift and peaceful end to a massive environmental lawsuit without setting foot in a courtroom.

Tophatter has had a few glitches with their software...the missed alert for my customer being one of them. The other one was their server crashed on Saturday night in the middle of the weekend bazaar auction mostly due to the number of auction attendees in the room, I think. It took them about 20 minutes to reset everything and they were back in business. The staff have been very attentive to their customers...buyers and sellers alike.

I've been dating a little bit, and its been fun. Both men and women. There is one very pretty grrrrr in Ellensburg but it seems like we are both gravitating in different directions. I've found someone that I think I really like, and I'm a little surprised because it is not someone that would ever catch my eye...I mean, the kind of person that you go by in the grocery store and don't even notice. But once you make yourself look, well, his heart is like a kaleidoscope of radiant gems and syrups. My own juices are flowing with the bright heat of summer, and love is floating with the fuzzy cotton tree seeds in the wind.

Did you know that in the world today there are 143 million orphans? They have no family to claim them and no parents to call their own. Many of them age out of the orphanages and become homeless, turning to drugs, suicide, or prostitution. Yet they are not without hope! The Lord cares for the orphans and following God's call in our life, we desire to give them a home, love, and a family to call their own. Please join us in praying for the orphans around the world that they would have enough food to eat, for someone to care for them, and for their protection. Please also pray that God would care for and provide for them until their adopting families can come get them. Pray that God would give us wisdom, discernment, and insight as we raise our adopted children.
Fuck cellphones. How the fuck do we think we're ever going to stay on this planet if we keep pumping so much shit into cellphones. You know what they're doing, right? They're making it so our entire life can be carried on one tiny fucking handheld thing. Imagine that. A monopoly on life itself. I'm waiting for the day when cellphones actually spew out Starbucks coffee. It'll happen. It'll fuckin' HAPPEN. You'd figure with all these amazing additions to portable communication, they'd actually make a phone that could fuckin' work as a PHONE!

Well, with the return of summer, and my recently purchased, though not yet assembled MLT, the time has come to make some beer.

The point here is surely not to deride empiricism. Heaven knows conservatism could stand to quit leading with its heart and start thinking more empirically about the world as it is, not the world as they wish it to be. The point, if I'm reading them correctly, is that too many leading voices on the left give themselves over to wonkiness, and presume that their moral convictions are widely shared, such that the only reason anybody could disagree with them is through ignorance (willful or not), or malice.

UPDATE (1): 20th December, 2011. The Irish Times has the inside track today on the Daly settlement (1) 17-20 Bond Street has indeed, according to the newspaper, been sold to LVMH for 350m (GBP 300m, chances are that the GBP 300m is correct and at current exchange rates the price tag is 358m) and (2) the Dalys have handed back 80m of assets to NAMA which had previously, reportedly, been transferred by the Dalys outside the ownership of the specific borrowers and (3) the 80m handed back includes 17m in cash which was reportedly transferred by David Daly to his wife, Mary. The Irish Times reports that the settlement means " NAMA has recovered the 457 million debt owed by Mr Daly and his family" but that statement presupposes the assets recovered by NAMA are worth the difference between the 457m face value of the loans and the 350m-odd proceeds from the 17-20 Bond Street sale to LVMH. However, this is beginning to look like a solid success for NAMA if (a) it has recovered the face value of loans which it bought at a discount from AIB and (b) NAMA didn't lose the Daly challenge about consultation and (c) NAMA is not stuck with what are likely to be substantial legal costs - on this last point we should find out in January 2012 what is happening to costs.

The point of cleavage between those who hold the crude theory of Baptismal regeneration, ex opere operato, and those who maintain what is usually spoken of as the "Hypothetical Theory," lies just here. The former believe that the recital of a formula and the performance of a particular action necessarily produce the spiritual effect of regeneration; the latter hold that where believing prayer is offered for a blessing, which we have reason to believe it is God's will to grant, that prayer will be provisionally answered. The former believe that this spiritual result is absolute, and admits of being neither reversed nor supplemented; the latter maintain that the result, whatever it is, must needs be provisional in its character, and cannot be made absolute until the condition upon which in the case of an adult it is contingent is complied with. The former maintain that the saving effect of this ordinance may be lost by wilful sin; the latter maintain that such saving effects only remain if the condition on which they are contingent is complied with, and, even where wilful sin does not occur, are forfeited by the non-fulfilment of the appointed condition. According to the former theory, no baptized member of our congregations needs to be born again, or, indeed, can be, although his life may be a discredit to our common humanity, and it would seem that the only hope for him lay in the possibility of so radical a change ; according to the other, all who have never consciously exercised faith in the special promise of God made in Baptism need to be told, "Ye must be born again." The difference between the two positions, which may seem to be slight, is really radical. The Gorham judgment given on appeal by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council affirmed that the hypothetical explanation of the formularies of the Church of England was a perfectly reasonable and legitimate one, though it did not affirm that it was the only possible interpretation. See GORHAM CASE.
Now, I don't want to sound like I'm crapping on the whole movie, because I actually did enjoy it. I think they did some perfect casting with Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades. They are two of my favorite actors, and I can't think of any two people more perfect for those two roles. I also have a huge crush on the ruggedly handsome Sam Worthington, and Mads Mikkelson is pretty much great in everything he does, and this is no exception. My favorite part of the movie was the whole Medusa scene. From Io explaining the Medusa backstory to Perseus cutting off her head, it is amazing! Its nuts because they all survive these giant ass scorpions, and the three witches (also a cool scene.."a sacrifice!"), but they all drop like flies when it comes to Medusa. She doesn't even have to do anything. She looks at you...you die. End of story.

Step 2 - Drop and Bake: Drop batter by tablespoon onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in a well pre-heated 350º F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Do not over-bake. Cookies should be a bit gooey in the center. While warm, they will be very soft on the outside, as well. Allow them to cool on the pan a few minutes and then transfer carefully to a rack to finish cooling. (They will always be somewhat soft because these are gooey fudge brownie cookies, not hard or crunchy cookies.)
Several people have asked me for easy, healthy recipes. I'm kind of a wing-it person, so I'm always on the look-out for good websites or books to help with quick, easy cooking. I found one that's definitely a keeper. Simple Food for Busy Families: The Whole Life Nutrition Approach is a fabulous resource with step-by-step instructions on how to turn your family's bad eating habits around. The first half of the book addresses everything from getting enough sleep to why it makes sense to eat seasonal food. Each section gives practical tips on how to implement changes slowly in your family's routine so that eventually you're eating better and feeling better.

The implication of preparing to move Russian troops not only is to protect its own vital regional interests but possibly to assist Iran in the event of such an attack. Sources add that a Russian military buildup in the region could result in the Russian military potentially engaging Israeli forces, U.S. forces, or both.

Eliminate mold. Keeping warm air out and dehumidifiers and air conditioners on helps keep your air fresh and also prevents mold from growing. To rid your home of mold, any non-washable materials, such as carpeting, need to be disposed of. Washable materials can be washed with a 5% chlorine bleach solution.

I wrote my first story at age twelve. My best friend moved out of the state but she still wanted to know what was going on since she left, so I wrote her a story. I fell in love with storytelling then but realized I could actually be a writer about a year ago.

Apparently we aren't the only ones who are connectivity-deprived on the Island - the line to get in and get online starts at about 9 on a Tuesday morning (the library is heartlessly closed on Sunday and Monday) with people flopped about the lawn looking listless and bereft. Then the doors open promptly at 10 and everybody pours into the adorable edifice on 58 North Summer Street.
I followed my parent's home, even though they weren't aware of my presense. My mom wept all the way while my dad remained silent. He begged my mom to calm down but it all fell on deaf ears. We got home to find the house filled with friends and relatives, my Dad carried my body and laid it on the mat in the living room. Prayers for forgiveness were said, and my parents were advised to stop crying as it wouldn't bring me back. I watched my Mom cry and weep all night as she asked God why He Had to take my life.

By the time Douglas Jardine's Bodyline series came around, Bradman was only 24 and had already scored 2695 runs in 19 Tests at 112.3 with 12 centuries, including the world record score of 334. The Bodyline was his weakest series but he still managed 396 runs in 4 games at an average of 56.75 (higher than the career averages of Lara, Tendulkar, Chappell, Gavaskar and Ponting). He scored 12 double centuries in just 80 innings and registered a further seven 150+ scores. His tragically legendary average of 99.94 is one of the most widely known sport statistics worldwide. He is not just the greatest batsman in cricket history but also one of the greatest sportspersons ever, with the Time magazine rating him alongside the likes of Muhammad Ali, Babe Ruth, Juan Manuel Fangio and Pele. Bradman is much more than an icon or a hero; he is a figure that transcends the game he played and stands for something much greater than that. Bradman is the epitome of the pinnacle of human achievement in sports.
He's not a star pupil, but he's pretty good. He's not the most diligent of swots, and needs to be told to make his bed or tidy his room. But amazingly, although he occasionally issues me with warnings not to embarrass him (I know, what a spoilsport!), he still seems to like spending some of his time with us.

I spent this past weekend at a retreat at the Seabeck Conference Center. I had to smile as I drove into Seabeck. The business district, if I don't count the Conference Center, consists of only about a half a dozen buildings, but when I arrived in town I was greeted by a small gray building with a bright blue door. White trim around the window caused the red "Espresso" sign to pop. I decided to go inside. The usual rows of flavors were lined up on a shelf; an espresso machine and a barista were visible from behind a tiny counter. Five or six wooden stools filled the remaining floor space- stools that were all occupied by the locals. They are a generous lot. I discovered that they will tease anyone. They didn't penalize me for being a visitor; locals and visitors are all teased alike.

Then as the conversation wasn't really going to settle anywhere and it was already getting late, I just moved them on to starting to prep the weeks passage. Esther said, we need to talk. So they went into doing personal time with the text and we talked in someone's room. She was visibly distraught and shared her heart that she was upset in the unbelief that had been coming out in our discussion of what to do about large group. At first I was a little taken aback but as she shared her heart and I reflected back on the conversation, I could see that she was right. We had but Jesus back into a box declaring for him what he could/couldnt do in and through our new people hours after having taken him our of the box at fall con. I felt convicted of my own desire to appease people and unbelief of how Jesus could work at UCI. So we came back together with our leaders and Esther shared her heart, her Holy discontent at what had just transpired and it led to a time of repentance from all of our leaders. That would have been cool enough but in the midst of that time, Jesus ministered to the leader I had prayed with at Fall Con by calling out some of the lies he believed about himself being the weak link in the group as we all affirmed him. It was a beautiful moment of the Holy Spirit doing what was on its agenda, not ours. Please pray that we continue to be open to the interruption of the Spirit.
I have recently become aware of a theory that suggests as we move closer towards 21st December 2012, Earth's timelines converge and we essentially get down to only two timelines. Timeline 1 which is positive and results in the New World/Golden Age and timeline 2 which results in the New World Order controlling this planet. We are apparently on timeline 1. Can the Nine shed any light on this theory?
leave all his land to his eldest son unless that son converted to Protestantism; if the son did not convert, then the land would be divided amongst all the dead man's children, thus reducing the size of estates owned by Catholics. If a Protestant converted to Catholicism, they would be arrested, their land and assets would be seized and they would be imprisoned, without trial, for as long as the government liked. Irish Catholics were banned from buying land in Ireland; orphanages were banned from giving children to Catholic families for adoption; no Catholic could inherit land or money from a Protestant; no Catholic could own a horse worth more than £5; Roman Catholic priests had to register with the government and to inform them of their movements; special government permission had to be sought for the Mass to be said and it could not be celebrated for large congregations; only Protestant churches could be built from stone and near main roads, Catholic churches had to be constructed from wood and kept to the back roads or countryside. If a Protestant informed the government of anyone breaking the Penal Laws, then the government would be allowed to reward him by fining the local Catholic

As someone with Type 1 diabetes (the "real" diabetes, as I like to put it -- the kind you can't help getting), I sometimes wonder when I'll end up retiring, or how long I can escape death. So I wonder how much I should be saving for retirement. Will I get the typical 25-30 year long retirement? Or would I have to retire at 40 to pull that one off? If I work until I'm 65, I could have lots put away, only to die within 2 years if I'm lucky, on the other hand.

The Territory is often referred to as the 'Top End' and is also home to 'the Alice' and 'the Red Centre'. It has plenty of 'Outback' and 'Dreamtime Land' and a rather large portion of extreme 'bugger all'.

That's about it.

Montana is the latest establishment in the ever-growing stable of cool-kid haunts owned and operated by Paris graffiti artist-turned-entrepreneur, Monsieur André. He's made a packet for himself by buying up interesting old bars and turning them into dens of beautiful-people iniquity. He launched his Paris bar empire with Le Baron, in the 8th arrondissement, a former brothel that, about four years ago became the place to see, be seen and dance ironically to hits of the 80s.

It's also not clear how much we should cheer the 64.6 percent increase in the number of Black-owned non-employer firms. Average revenues at these firms dropped 10.7 percent in real terms between 2002 and 2007. Perhaps more importantly, in 2007 the average revenue at a Black-owned non-employer firm was only $18,500 (in 2002 dollars).
Writing stories of such a concise length makes you think about the importance of every single word, and is a great exercise to improve your writing skills. So get thinking and get writing. And whilst you're at it, get looking at the official National Flash-Fiction Competition.
In five stories, Christie allows the murderer to escape justice (and in the case of the last three, implicitly almost approves of their crimes); these are The Witness for the Prosecution, The Man in the Brown Suit, Murder on the Orient Express, Curtain and The Unexpected Guest. (When Christie adapted Witness into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed.) There are also numerous instances where the killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but instead dies (death usually being presented as a more 'sympathetic' outcome), for example Peril at End House, Death on the Nile, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Crooked House, Appointment with Death, The Hollow, and Secret Adversary. In some cases this is with the collusion of the detective involved. Five Little Pigs, and arguably Ordeal by Innocence, end with the question of whether formal justice will be done unresolved.

Roger Webster, who gives a rather simplistic view of the historical facts in his bedside book - "The Illustrated at the Fireside - Pg 56", gives some insight into how it came about that the British press of that time managed to frame Hermanus Potgieter as a rogue and a villain. At that time the Volksraad of the Transvaal had passed a law prohibiting barter with the local people, under a penalty of £37.10. The object of the law ---- now listen carefully, ---- was to keep the peace! The fact that someone was going to make lots of money was beside the point!
Sure, the sets are overlit (every frame of Season 24 was overlit - why change things for this story?). Yes, the cliffhanger gag at the end of episode one is not just ghastly, but one of the dumbest moments ever, in all of Doctor Who. True, the bulk of the Iceworld sets are never even remotely convincing, not for a second (though Kane's lair is effective enough). The less said about the appearance of the "Dragon," the better. And I will never in a million years understand what they were going for with the C-subplot of that irritating little girl and her mother, a strand which fails on every level, but especially at being cute. Melanie. Yep, "Dragonfire" has its fair share of McCoy-era fuck-ups, and yet they somehow never really overpower the stronger aspects of the story.

I don't know.maybe nobody else feels like this about indie publishing. But this is sort of where I think I am with it. It's wonderful on so many levels - but its big flaw, I think, is that it's just too easy. Too easy to implement.too easy to mess up.too easy to get discouraged (because your frame of reference when you're solo is really quite small). Too easy, essentially, to jump in when you're green and flounder around.because you're green.

"The Wallflower" rose to No. 2 on the rhythm-and-blues charts in 1954. As was often the case in those days with records by black performers, a toned-down version was soon recorded by a white singer and found a wider audience: Georgia Gibbs's version, with the title and lyric changed to "Dance With Me, Henry," was a No. 1 pop hit in 1955. (Its success was not entirely bad news for Ms. James. She shared the songwriting royalties with Mr. Ballard and the bandleader and talent scout Johnny Otis, who had arranged for her recording session. (Mr. Otis died on Tuesday.)
What I have not found is any evidence that the motive for farm murders is "genocide". The perpetrators are sometimes caught, tried and convicted. In how many of these cases has the motive been proved to be "genocide"? If the genocide propagandists can show that this morive has been proved in the majority of cases (a 51% majority will do), then I will be prepared to take their contentions seriously. But until they do that, I will take their assertions with several bags of salt, and merely white racist propaganda. Sannie sê Sannie sal sewe sakke sout sleep.

The tan color deepened to brown and spread around me. To my astonishment, the area of color developed, like a photo, into a vision of a man with chocolate-brown skin. He superimposed himself over the left side of my face and upper chest and my left arm, and I perceived him as if from the inside and the outside at the same time. I could actually see him, with technicolor clarity, something that had never, ever happened to me before. He looked to be in his mid-thirties, with very round cheeks and prominent eyes, a little like Louis Armstrong. I heard the name "Bertram."

For me it didn't get bad until after the D&C. I suppose I assumed that it would be the same this time. But then I have to remind myself that it was almost as if I had 3 weeks to deal with the shock of it all before I actually "lost" my baby. This time I knew that I couldn't deal with the emotional turmoil associated with waiting for things to happen naturally as my body obviously has a very difficult time letting go. I gave myself one day to let in soak in, to say goodbye to my sweet child, and then took Cytotec again (which this time didn't even make me bleed at all) and had the D&C on Thursday.

For this also there is no technological or large-scale solution. Perhaps, as they believe, the most conscientiously up-to-date people can easily do without local workshops and stores, local journalism, a local newspaper, a local post office, all of which supposedly have been replaced by technologies. But what technology can replace personal privacy or the coherence of a family or a community? What technology can undo the collateral damages of an inhuman rate of technological change?

Alan was born in the Auvergnat town of Riom. His father Georges (Jord in Breton) Cochevelou was a civil servant in the French Ministry of Finance who achieved his dream of recreating a Celtic or Breton harp in the small town of Gourin, Brittany. In 1953, Alan began playing the instrument at the age of nine under the tutelage of his father and Denise Megevand, a concert harpist. Alan also learned Celtic mythology, art and history as well as the Breton language, traditional Breton dance and the Scottish bagpipe and the bombarde, a traditional Breton instrument, from the oboe family. Alan began playing concerts at eleven years and studying traditional Breton, English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh folk music, also learning the drum, Irish flute, and tin whistle. He competed in and won several Breton traditional music competitions in the Bleimor Pipe band. Alan spent his childhood in Paris, with its cosmopolitan influences from France, Algeria, Morocco and elsewhere. But he fell in love with Breton music and Celtic culture in general, and often went back in his teens to Brittany.

One of the things we appreciate Farah for is her determination that her leading men should be objectified as much as, if not a little more than, the glamorous heroines. She outdoes herself with Dard-e-Disco which has hilariously bad lyrics (apparently she kept telling Javed Akhtar to make his lyrics worse) and is full of gratuitous shots of SRK in, emerging from, and being doused with, water.

I had extra batter so I made two other small pans of bread to use as samples at the market. The pans are really small; I felt like I was cooking with my Easy Bake Oven! Also, as my loaf tins were smaller, I baked them for about 20 minutes.
18. Ditched school to do something more fun? - No. I was a square. No sneaking, no ditching. I enjoyed the social aspects of school too much to want to ditch it.
2. Ngoni Makusha NCAA 100 Victory - Nothing like a great 100 to thrill the senses, and this was such a race. Channeling the spirits of Bob Hayes, Carl Lewis and Donovan Bailey, the slow starting Makusha blazed through the middle of the pack for the win in an NCAA record 9.89!
You know the old phrase, "Stop and smell the roses"? I think stopping to smell the lilacs is even more important since their luscious blooms only happen for a short time each year. I have to remember to jam my nose into their blooms (checking for bees first, of course) and drink up all their sweet fragrance often before it's gone.

During the evenings the crickets and cicadas sing. Combined with roosters, hens, ducks, wild birds, yowling skinny cats and the nightly chorus sent up by the campus's dog population this can all add up to quite the racket at bed time. Speaking of ducks, on my walk home from the office yesterday a tiny yellow duckling waddled across the open-air hallway I was threading my way through, looking lost yet determined. I hope he's found his way to safety, it's a jungle out there.

I do owe you guys an apologie, for not responding, reacting or following your blogs. It's not that i don't want to, but this project is time and energy consuming, so i don't take the time to either comment or write a simple thank you. So i take the opportunity now to tell you, that it's highly appreciated that you follow my blog and read about a project like this.and actually liking it :-p

At the wheel of Falken Tire's Porsche 911 GT3 RSR, the winning car at Mid-Ohio and Baltimore, Bryan Sellers (USA) posted the ninth quickest time. He contests the race with Porsche factory pilot Wolf Henzler (Germany). "We didn't have an optimal set-up today, but we know that our car and the tyres will perform much better in the race than in the qualifying," explained Bryan Sellers. Wolf Henzler added: "The circuit was very cold over the last days. Today we have sun and the asphalt temperatures were suddenly much higher. That changed everything. Our team still simply lacks the experience of reacting to such changes in a short timeframe."
But even getting out officially isn't easy. I believe that the US and its allies don't really give a tinker's curse about Afghanistan; as far as they are concerned, if the Afghans are intent on living in a barbaric medieval theocracy, where women are treated as chattels, those who don't share the faith of the rulers live in fear of death, and there're more or less continual low-level wars between various tribes, then they're welcome to do so. Admittedly, there is the poppy problem - Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of non-pharmaceutical grade opiates (92% in 2007) and also, incidentally, the world's largest producer of hashish - but, despite all the hype about the so-called War on Drugs, I have a feeling that (for all sorts of reasons, many sordid, which I won't go into here) the US and most other countries can live with that. No, the real problems are the two 500 pound

I learned about Oh My Melodies from Espousal Records' Kyoungmo Kim as he updated me on the current whereabouts of the members of emo pop band I Love JH. I was instantly charmed by what I heard and returned to listen every now and then. Recently this has happened more frequently, and for reasons that will become obvious tomorrow I found the perfect opportunity to find out more about Oh My Melodies straight from the source:

The support actors, in particular Shreyas Talpade and Arjun Rampal are well cast in their roles. Being a Farah Khan film, of course the songs are exceptionally well choreographed and filmed. One of the things we appreciate Farah for is her determination that her leading men should be objectified as much as, if not a little more than, the glamorous heroines. She outdoes herself with Dard-e-Disco which has hilariously bad lyrics (apparently she kept telling Javed Akhtar to make his lyrics worse) and is full of gratuitous shots of SRK in, emerging from, and being doused with, water.
She kept going . and zoom she went off closing the gate without putting on her tudung.

Chairman of the Man Booker Prize commented:
It was a simple chance event on a London underground station that got me thinking about luck, chance and randomness and led many years later to my new novel, Wasted. It wasn't an earth-shattering event but it got me thinking. Obsessively. So, I began a novel for adults - I'd two unpublished ones languishing already - about chance, quantum mechanics, and unpredictability, involving repeated multiple possibilities. The idea was that if there is a god - which I know there isn't - he will either play dice or at least have a lot of fun observing. But halfway through, a completely different idea hit me, this time for teenagers. I abandoned god and quantum

The French have been particularly explicit in their imperial intentions regarding the Middle East and Africa:
I don't know if this piece has any kind of value today. Maybe the fact that the whole set is now dismantled, must decrease its value. And although such ensemble was (and still is) far from cheap, my mom paid only half of its retail value because she could get it directly from the factory where one of her friend worked back then.
SB 10.88.25-26: The great demigods could only remain silent, not knowing how to counteract the benediction. Then LordSiva reached the luminous realm of Vaikuntha, beyond all darkness, where the Supreme Lord Narayana is manifest. That realm is the destination of renunciants who have attained peace and given up all violence against other creatures. Going there, one never returns.

When I was in college, I had also worked on the programming side of radio. One of my favorite projects was a weekly show I initiated, combining the music and folklore of different cultures. (I like to claim I invented world beat.) I knew almost nothing about either, so it was a big adventure each week to go to the university's excellent music-school library and rummage through the record bins.
I've mentioned many reasons for having "photowednesdays" on this blog. some reasons are current events love of Brooklyn and keeping my idle hands from being the devils playthings. I've probably also mentioned it's not always easy to find a new pic of something Brooklyn-centric or born that's interesting. I never want photo Wednesdays to turn into a catalogue of cliched pics of the bridge or the arch.

The other concern the WEF report raised was the short-term increase in carbon dioxide projected for Germany which, with today's global warming problems, cannot be taken lightly. The report say that "carbon emissions will also rise, with an increase of between 170 million and 400 million tonnes of carbon dioxide between 2011 and 2020, as Germany turns to coal and gas plants to replace nuclear generation in the short-term."

I had never seen so many hippies in one place outside Central Park. We were all over the grounds and buildings, setting up tents and campsites outdoors and inside, utilizing the communal kitchen, and playing together everywhere. Perhaps what amazed me most during that week was how careful we were to keep the place clean, how nothing was trashed or damaged, how all of us were committed to leaving the grounds as we'd found them or even better.

You guys ever hear of the Binger, Bing Crosby? He's like Dean Martin, except not drunk all the time and--as far as I know--doesn't try to drug some young woman into a "white Christmas" and his "holiday inn", if you know what I'm saying. If you don't, well, you need to catch up on your classic Christmas movies. Commie. Also, what the hell? Barenaked Ladies made one helluva Christmas album a few years ago, with new songs and traditional. And it's awesome. Try throwing that in every once in a while instead of another rendition of Frosty the Snowman.

But all is not so well in a number of other cases. Holt paid debut novelist Jed Rubenfeld $800,000 for The Interpretation of Murder, gave away 10,000 advance-review copies, conducted a major publicity blitz, and did a first printing of 185,000 copies. The book was published almost six months ago, and, at last report, had moved about 26,000 copies. I calculate that Mr. Rubenfeld's unearned portion of the $800,000 is roughly $732,400.

Well, we never made that myrtle. The problem wasn't the hogs busting us. It was the coyote. One old mangy dog was loitering around the herd. These pigs were big enough not to be bothered by a pesky song dog, but they certainly took notice of him after he caught wind of our activities and bounded away. The coup de grace, though, were the turkeys. A couple hens were holding sentry and naturally took off when they saw us, taking the finally-frightened hogs with them. Wild pigs don't have the best sense of sight, but they're wary enough to recognize something amiss. (And how strange is it to find a coyote, hogs, and turkeys hanging around each other outside of a Disney movie?)

We can tend to use spirituality like medicine or a hospital. We utilize it only when things aren't going right or when we're suffering financially, emotionally or relationally. Our pain and suffering, however, can be a path to transcending this selfish conception of spirituality into something more. It can make us ask the questions we normally wouldn't ask, and can lead us to bigger and broader questions, such "what's really the purpose of life?" and "how can we avoid suffering?"

Having just been exposed to tombs, mummies and the world of Hatshepsut full-throttle in a middle school text book, it seemed more fitting than ever to face the crowds and potential chaos with three kids ages 6 - 11, all in the name of seeing the real thing. And, with no more strollers or diapers to consider, it was well worth the attempt.
He's not a star pupil, but he's pretty good. He's not the most diligent of swots, and needs to be told to make his bed or tidy his room. But amazingly, although he occasionally issues me with warnings not to embarrass him (I know, what a spoilsport!), he still seems to like spending some of his time with us.

I first saw this H&M snake-embossed envelope clutch weeks ago at a location in the city, fell in love (who would've thought since I hate snakes?!), but passed because I didn't have my 20% coupon with me. Days later, when I was ready to actually buy, I couldn't find it anywhere in the stores near me. This is what I get for wanting to save $4 lol. I was about to give up when I recently revisited one of the stores and saw they had restocked. Hallelujah!

A pipe dream, I know, as so many see the wheels as an extension of their existence. Could one really expect all the insecure men fearful about the size of their penises to not hop into these big trucks so they can feel big in the world? It is human men like this who are behind the wars and the need t smash things.
I followed my parent's home, even though they weren't aware of my presense. My mom wept all the way while my dad remained silent. He begged my mom to calm down but it all fell on deaf ears. We got home to find the house filled with friends and relatives, my Dad carried my body and laid it on the mat in the living room. Prayers for forgiveness were said, and my parents were advised to stop crying as it wouldn't bring me back. I watched my Mom cry and weep all night as she asked God why He Had to take my life.

By the time Douglas Jardine's Bodyline series came around, Bradman was only 24 and had already scored 2695 runs in 19 Tests at 112.3 with 12 centuries, including the world record score of 334. The Bodyline was his weakest series but he still managed 396 runs in 4 games at an average of 56.75 (higher than the career averages of Lara, Tendulkar, Chappell, Gavaskar and Ponting). He scored 12 double centuries in just 80 innings and registered a further seven 150+ scores. His tragically legendary average of 99.94 is one of the most widely known sport statistics worldwide. He is not just the greatest batsman in cricket history but also one of the greatest sportspersons ever, with the Time magazine rating him alongside the likes of Muhammad Ali, Babe Ruth, Juan Manuel Fangio and Pele. Bradman is much more than an icon or a hero; he is a figure that transcends the game he played and stands for something much greater than that. Bradman is the epitome of the pinnacle of human achievement in sports.

Time for some calculations.
The new characters were incredibly underdeveloped; Angelica, Blackbeard, the Minister, and the mermaid all felt forced upon the audience as if we were suppose to enjoy them, but realistically they were just annoying. Angelica is mad at Jack for taking her virginity (wasn't pirates suppose to be geared for Children?) Blackbeard hides in his cabin for most of the film (wasn't he the scariest pirates of all time?) the Minister falls in love with the mermaid (who in this film can shoot spiderwebs from their wrists like Spider-Man) just because he sees her naked (again, Disney, Pirates, Children?) and the Mermaid needs to shed one tear (there were enough tears of pain from the audience to solve that problem).
We love pork belly, but here it is more traditionally used as "pancetta", boiled in stocks and soups to add flavour or cut into tiny chunks and done on the plancha (griddle) or deep fried as a little tapas. Often it will have the skin removed.

But this movie is not made for people like me. It is made for a different demographic, which is fine. I knew it going in, but I had heard enough to suggest it would have, like, cross-subcultural appeal. It did not. I would almost rather watch a regular romcom/dramedy or whatever this was because at least it isn't trying to pretend it's all that different from the mainstream.

There was a problem, though, in that, when they were attempting to insert a guide wire-thing into her esophagus, they popped a hole in her LARYNX. So, they had to take out all their guides and scopes and instruments while the doctor consulted with another laparoscopic doctor and an ENT to decide if this was a big deal. Apparently, it should heal on its own, provided there isn't any infection, so they just sewed up the hole, put everything back in, and finished the operation; hence, FIVE AND A HALF HOUR surgery.

The biggest emotion, though, is probably regret. Even though I was at the hospital several different times the week before he died, I never found the courage to really talk to him, to tell him that I forgave him for all the bad stuff. For the most part, I put all that behind me a long time ago, and focused on remembering the good times, the memories that can still make me smile. And that man is the one I miss, the man I wish was still here for Amy, to walk her down the aisle, to spoil our grandchildren, to sing to them.....
"Have you seen Steven yet?" A woman asked us as she walked into our building. We gave her a confused look, pretending to have no idea what she was talking about. Acting at its finest. "I guess Steven Seagal is shooting a show here," she explained. We had her fooled. Can anyone say Oscar?!
Whenever our right becomes the guiding factor of our lives, it dulls our spiritual insight. The greatest enemy of the life of faith in God is not sin, but good choices which are not quite good enough. The good is always the enemy of the best. In this passage, it would seem that the wisest thing in the world for Abram to do would be to choose. It was his right, and the people around him would consider him to be a fool for not choosing.

The guru, or acaryadeva, as we learn from the bona fide scriptures, delivers the message of the absolute world, the transcendental abode of the Absolute Personality, where everything nondifferentially serves the Absolute Truth. We have heard so many times: mahajano yena gata sa pantha ("Traverse the trail which your previous acarya has passed"), but we have hardly tried to understand the real purport of this sloka. If we scrutinizingly study this proposition, we understand that the mahajana is one, and the royal road to the transcendental world is also one. In the Muaka Upaniad (1.2.12) it is said:

Hello again! Just another quick update to keep you all up to speed.
On his pillow,
Thus, no doubt soon you will probly hear soon some business leaders or pretend potential self-appointed communist leaders lamenting the lack of organization of the #Occupy movements, describing them as "in choate" (which is a kind of wide penis with no head), or "udderless," or "lacking discernible goals" (like Sporting Gijon). What they are really mean is that there is a ferment of new ideas that therefore could be dangerous and must be curtailed, or at least curtopped. After all, nobody has any idea where a march that goes nowhere might end up. If these peoples weren't too feckless to emigrate we could at least lure them onto a ferry with the promise of jobs in Australia and transport them there. We would never hear of them ever again! But while they are there, in the midst of ordinary, heads-down, knees-back God-fearing punters, fermenting theories without limitations and trying out new processes, such as democracy-never a positive development-they constitute a threat to our docile, passive, obedient way of life. They must be stomped on by square-headed baton-wielding riot police, preferably from up the country, before any new ideas seep out into the public body at large, like a ball of ideological pus.
Boris you beauty! Bojo's latest epistle in the DT opens with him at the ArcelorMittal Orbit structure in Stratford; "This sculpture is a masterpiece, far better and more rewarding up close than it appears at a distance".

Please read what he says about the BBC, Blair and Brown. An opinion which I share of course...
At around dusk, Emi asked if I wanted to go for a walk in the woods, and of course I said yes. We picked up a friend of hers on the way. It rained this afternoon, and everything had that fresh, sweet smell that you always get after rain in the spring time. The Peepers were deafening as we picked our way through the slick mud, over wet rocks, and through damp grasses, fending off mosquitoes as we went. Emi tried to catch a frog (it was brown, though we're not sure what type it was.) as we wound our way through the flooded areas, looking for peepers and other frogs. We saw the colour of the sky through the trees as the sun set.

If you are a woman, and you hold Friedrich Nietzsche in high esteem as one of the great enlightened thinkers of modern philosophy, there is a decent chance you might be unfamiliar with the full extent of the man's musings about the fairer sex. Since his own lifetime, the philosopher has been accused of promoting misogynistic ideas in his writings, due to his tendency of abrasively referring to women-and femininity as a whole-in largely hostile terms (as we shall explore shortly). However, it should be stated for the sake of objectivity, that this sentiment is not universally accepted amongst prominent female authors and thinkers, as some of these individuals interpret Nietzsche's apparently sexist aphorisms as a rhetorical strategy, used to illustrate the vain construct men have of women, and the potential to possibly move beyond this simplistic sentiment.[1] Whether any of these more favorable interpretations are viable positions in light of Nietzsche's own words, or simply attempts to exonerate the philosopher of the charge of misogyny, is the focus of the analysis that follows below. Although Nietzsche never wrote a single cumulative work on the topic of womanhood, his books are nevertheless filled with countless critiques and examinations of the female psych, thereby making it possible for the reader to gather a coherent impression of the philosopher's views on women, and gender relations in general.

Well, personally, I tend to spy a certain vulgarity when such impossibly subjective matters are stated like facts in this way (though I blame neither the brewery nor the organisers of this event for feeling the need to enter into the spirit of a good old public relations exercise every once in a while). I do also wonder whether an ale of such bloodcurdling power really ought to be hailed in this way on a global scale - looking at it from moral/public health perspective.

Watching my children and the aspirations that they have got me thinking. When do children stop aspiring to be heros? Ask any boy what he wants to be when he grows up and you're likely to be answered with things like firefighter, police officer, super hero, doctor. I've yet to meet a child who dreamed of being an accountant, lawyer, or sanitation engineer(though to be fair, my kids get really excited when the garbage truck comes rolling past our house). There is nothing wrong with any of the professions I've just mentioned, and I think they're all equally important. Perhaps we feel as we grow older that if we can't be super heros, then why bother trying? That, and being a super hero isn't a real job. A number of people are quite keen to pitch in around the community, or help someone on the side of the highway with a flat tire. We generally stop actively looking for people to help though.

Digitopia, John Akomfrah, UK. Experimental, 33 min.
High Priestess Ondelle is convinced by an old proverb that Brigitta is fated to travel to the former home of the Ancients to help her find the answer. But when they get there, they discover that hundreds of years ago, when the faeries were moved north to the protected realm, some faeries were left behind.

When the captain of your ship tells you to do something in a somewhat frenzied or stern voice, it's almost always for your own good and everyone else's, so you should just shut your mouth and do it. And not get defensive about it.
Anyway, one hour, one Crayola marker, one pair of scissors several straight pins, and one sewing machine later, I have this fitted pencil skirt. It's a little too short for the office, but I'm hoping the tights will hide my legs enough that no one will complain.

For example, it might be a company trying to decide whether to launch a new product or expand into a new market; a private equity company trying to decide whether to acquire a company; a very brief description of a company's business model (no financial figures) where you have to advise them why their profits are declining. For strategy consulting, the problem may be expressed in a purely descriptive way - no detailed figures, tables or graphs to pore over, just a statement of the fundamental problem.

But ending her relationship with the bikini company did not make Farrow any less dangerous. Her near-nakedness remained on display in places like Penthouse Magazine, FHM Magazine, and numerous other places who trade on the twisted ways of immodest women and play with the safety of the world on a regular basis. And as the years went by, Farrow started adding more tattoos to her body, making her not only an immodest women, but an immodest women who violated divine commandments by marking her body! There can be little question that she can be held responsible for the 2008 Sichuan earthquake that killed over 68,000 people in China.
And so I began. I used the instructions I found online as my chief guide but after three days I was a little skeptical that the sour dough had fermented enough or produced enough yeast. My Twitter friend Finn said that he had been feeding his starter ("Veruca") for 12 days and it was now time. So I asked him if he thought my starter was ready? He confirmed what I thought and said no. So I've been letting "Finn Jr". grow and grow. Last night he became a rebellious teenager and we woke up to him trying to escape the safety of his jar to explore the world (thus the picture above this posting).
What advice would you give to aspiring artists today?
"I think we (at the Daily Sun) still have the trust of our readers," he says. "We've got our critics but, in most cases, they are not in our target market. We have a target market that is happy with us and they know that whenever they call us, we give them our undivided attention."
The ideas employed in foul play are given a false foundation but one that is seemingly real. They depend on the person to whom they present the ideas to mistake the reality. Thus the targeted person believes their somatic reactivity is evidence that the idea is real. And this is generally true. If we sense danger for instance, even though we don't have sensory information our body will move to fear because that is natural. It is the preparation of our body to face and deal with the danger. In foul play the danger card is play to cause the targeted person to mistakenly believe that the presented idea, of which they are more conscious, has led to their somatic arousal. This empowers the ideas. In reality the danger posed and the idea presented are unrelated. It is through trickery that the person targeted is brought along to believing in the ideas presented. And you will see that with certainty when you are no longer unsuspecting of the foul play having done the experiments and having seen how easily you can be manipulated while believing the medical misinformation. And that includes the psychiatric babble about misreading others if you are suspicious. What they are effectively saying is that you have to accept appearances at face value. That's self-serving garbage. When you have done the experiments and "wised up" or "level up" to use PC game parlance, then the foul game can't be played as to obtain a result. You can "walk through the valley of the shadow of death and fear no evil"! A knowledgeable person can stand against the evil mobs and win. I am living proof of that but you need to see that for yourselves. It is good for you to be sceptical of what I am presenting but please also be curious. This is not about some academic pursuit; this is a life and death matter. To be empowered and reap the benefits for yourselves you must realize the truth and not just know it.

One thing I have noticed after watching a number of these space shows is that unless you're watching a live feed from the space station, nobody can make a space show about ANY planet or moon without mentioning and showing digitally rendered footage, at least four times in an hour-long show, of a huge asteroid hitting the Earth and wiping out our entire existence. They're obsessed. Though I feel that the obsession probably has more to do with sensationalism to boost ratings than an obsession with the end of the world as we know it. The way they work that scenario into every show smacks of the sensationalism used to get people to watch the news every night. Jackasses.
Pevan's lip curled as she realised the other woman had jumped expecting Pevan to close the Gate beneath her, not bothering to choose an arc that would bring her to safe ground of her own accord. They certainly would need to have a chat about discipline. Still, there was no time for the horseplay of letting the Four Knot fall back through again. She snapped the Gate shut, and even then Notia stumbled on landing.

This book was emotional, and sometimes hard to read. But it was Lisa's lyrical and poetic style of writing that made me stay reading the story. I really loved Janie's character and I thought that throughout the series, she's really grown to accept who she is and what she can do.

Last week saw another turn of direction for the brand with the news that the Genii Capital-owned F1 team has terminated its sponsorship agreement with Group Lotus. Financial uncertainty has surrounded Group Lotus since the investment arm of the Malaysian Government, Khazanah, selling its near on 43 percent stake in Lotus parent company Proton, to another Malaysian entity, DRB-Hicom. Those famous insiders surfaced in various reports saying that the sale of Proton was a contributing reason for Genii cancelling its sponsorship agreement.

When I arrived in Cookeville, TN, an 18-year-old college freshman with no friends in a town far from home, I didn't know a whole lot. I was not a student of God's Word, and rarely contemplated matters of faith. I had no more than a vague idea about what I would do with my life. All I knew was that I loved music, and church seemed like a good place to meet friends.

This is an example of churnalism at its laziest worst. Or is it something more sinister? The statement from the court suggested that "Such inventions are a kind of blood libel, and we wonder why the inventor of the story did not continue to describe how we collected the blood of the dog to make our matzah." That might be going too far. But it says a lot about BBC journalism that they imagined that stoning reincarnated dog lawyers to death was the sort of thing Orthodox Jews get up to.

What ought to be acutely troubling is that the history of revisions to oil and gas resources has heretofore been one of increases. For the first time, we are now seeing not just downward revisions in estimated natural gas resources, but drastic downward revisions. That should tell us that the era of unlimited horizons for fossil fuels has come to a close. All the advanced technology that was supposed to bring unending plenty in the form of fossil fuels is now giving us better estimates of what will be available, namely, not nearly so much as we thought.

Ok, here's where I encountered some problems. Notice how the sides of my cake are SUPER brown, whereas the top is a nice green. This is bad. It makes the sides really tough. I think it means that it baked unevenly, also creating a dome shape on top. This became a problem later, when I went to slice it in half, horizontally. You'll see what I mean...more on this later.

Anyone who has sung in a cathedral choir in Britain or Ireland will know and love Stanford's church music, which set a standard and started a vigorous tradition what extended almost to the present day. But what I am uploading is one of his piano concertos, played with great verve by the young Irish pianist Finghin Collins. It's classic Stanford - you can hear a nod to Rachmaninoff in the first movement, but the bluff, muscular energy is very much Stanford. I played the first piano quartet a while back, and you notice the same thing - you have to dig into the music from bar one (literally for the strings, who have a wonderful flourish to open the work).

Scientists at Rothamsted are trialling a variety of GM wheat that produces a pheromone that aphids don't like. Aphids eat wheat, and reduce crop yields. If you can stop them from going near the wheat, then the yields should be higher. As a pre-emptive strike, I'm going to point out that the gene added to the wheat occurs naturally in many species of plant. It is not, as has been said, a 'cow gene'.

Then the doors open promptly at 10 and everybody pours into the adorable edifice on 58 North Summer Street.

I can tell you that I don't hate you, nor does Joan. All that's wanted by either of us is to have you out of her life. Hate has way of aging a person and eating away at them. It will eventually turn back on the person doing the hating, and affect them as much, or more, that it affects the object of that hate. Are you capable of letting go, or are hateful behavior and bullying the only languages you understand?
My mobile phone rings. It's my daughter's school. She has fallen over and has "a small hole" in her head. I finish my work at ten times the usual speed (I'd like to know how to do that) and head for the nearby hospital. On the roads, nobody seems to understand I'm in a rush and cars loiter and arc lazily. When I arrive finally, she is sitting on her teacher's lap, draped in a blanket as they wait to be seen. She seems dazed. I hug her and take a look at the cut. It looks as though she has been caught by a stray stud in a ruck. Her teacher tells me how loud the thump was when her head hit the floor, which is not something I really want to recap.
It all started well enough. I decided that instead of just sitting at the table eating green beans and rolls while everyone else told me how wonderful the turkey tasted, I'd go ahead and make myself a mock turkey out of tofu. I found a recipe, made a grocery list, and almost bought all of it.
Making dumplings is a great way to get over that after-work slump of forgoing the dinner plans and diving into a bag of microwave popcorn (I fully admit to having done this), because even though it takes awhile, it's pretty easy, and I felt like a kid in science class watching an experiment! These two dough logs blow up and get all slimy in a big pot of boiling water. Don't worry, the slime subsides by the time they're ready to eat :)

The next morning we made the short trip from Bela Vista, the small village on the Paraguayan border where we had stayed the previous night, to Fazenda Marilandia. This ranch is owned by Renata Stephen's (our tour guide) aunt, Maria Loureiro Pinheiro, and is managed by her son, (Renata's first cousin) Sergio Loureiro Pinheiro. The head cowboy, Roberto, was also available to show us around. He has been employed by Fazenda Marilandia for 35 years.
I have recently become aware of a theory that suggests as we move closer towards 21st December 2012, Earth's timelines converge and we essentially get down to only two timelines. Timeline 1 which is positive and results in the New World/Golden Age and timeline 2 which results in the New World Order controlling this planet. We are apparently on timeline 1. Can the Nine shed any light on this theory?

People today wrongly pray for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit as they say the disciples did in the upper room. But I tell you the disciples were not praying for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. They knew what was expected of them and I am sure they were seeking wisdom as to how to go about replacing Judas and preparing themselves for the great ministry that had been given to them.

As we approached Shoreditch, I spotted this building. I couldn't see a date on it but it looks Victorian. A deliciously extravagant design, this pub was once called Ye Olde Axe but the name has been painted over and the swinging sign has all but lost its paintwork. The building looks neglected and in need of repair, like something out of a Gothic horror film. An illuminated sign on the side reads "Striptease". Unsurprisingly, the clock no longer works. It is very sad to see buildings like this being allowed to fall into a state of neglected disrepair.

We've done a load of work at the White Horse previously (see Rounds 1, 2, 3, 4) but we were asked back to go over a wall that we've done previously (that was looking a little grubby due to the addition of some low-grade graffiti), freshen up the gents toilet door, take care of a tall wall beside the bar and also throw in a few little extras scattered around the place. The White Horse is one of our favourite local boozers so working there is always good fun and design-wise we've obviously run with the whole White Horse identity but given it a little id-iom twist.

The aroma was filled with the recognizable smell of Smith and Cross: strong, funky and full of promise. Of course the molasses was there as well, though I am still not sure if I was smelling the actual molasses or the Smith and Cross. Also, the pineapple spear, which was an utter garnish failure, awkward protuberance that it was, added a bit of undefinable fruitiness to the nose. The first sip was very molasses-y, though the hogo of the rum carried through at the end. You would think that there would be some sweetness in this drink, but it was dry and earthy, with a vague powdery texture that made each sip seem almost chewy. After I increased the bitters, the spices became more detectable on the swallow. The flavors of the molasses were also enhanced by the increase in bitters--the drink seemed sweeter, in that pleasing molasses cookie way, and the flavors in general seemed more balanced. Overall, not bad but not great.

What I have not found is any evidence that the motive for farm murders is "genocide". The perpetrators are sometimes caught, tried and convicted. In how many of these cases has the motive been proved to be "genocide"? If the genocide propagandists can show that this morive has been proved in the majority of cases (a 51% majority will do), then I will be prepared to take their contentions seriously. But until they do that, I will take their assertions with several bags of salt, and merely white racist propaganda. Sannie sê Sannie sal sewe sakke sout sleep.
Meet Samantha. But we hardly ever call her that. Mostly, we call her Little D. That's D, for Diva. Because it's all about her. After a long weekend visiting family in Pennsylvania, we came home and adopted her at the humane society. There, she was named Thelma. You can plainly see that name just didn't suit her. (Actually, I wanted to name her Tootsie and the hubby wanted to name her Tarot. Then I jokingly suggested Samantha because she was being a little naughty at the time - she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter. Anyway, I said to my hubby that we should call her Samantha because "naughty girls need love too". Ha. What can I say, I was a teenager in the 80s.)

Schirmbeck on Wednesday filed a formal complaint over the matter with Galveston County District Attorney Jack Roady. He also asked for an investigation into whether the city's use of public funds on pro-camera advertising on the public access television channel 16 and on the city's website violates state election law. In November, residents will have a chance to vote on whether to continue the photo ticketing program. Schirmbeck believes the slick video material was produced by Redflex, but the commercials did not disclose their true origin, in violation of state campaign laws.

In five stories, Christie allows the murderer to escape justice (and in the case of the last three, implicitly almost approves of their crimes); these are The Witness for the Prosecution, The Man in the Brown Suit, Murder on the Orient Express, Curtain and The Unexpected Guest. (When Christie adapted Witness into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed.) There are also numerous instances where the killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but instead dies (death usually being presented as a more 'sympathetic' outcome), for example Peril at End House, Death on the Nile, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Crooked House, Appointment with Death, The Hollow, and Secret Adversary. In some cases this is with the collusion of the detective involved. Five Little Pigs, and arguably Ordeal by Innocence, end with the question of whether formal justice will be done unresolved.
Alan was born in the Auvergnat town of Riom. His father Georges (Jord in Breton) Cochevelou was a civil servant in the French Ministry of Finance who achieved his dream of recreating a Celtic or Breton harp in the small town of Gourin, Brittany. In 1953, Alan began playing the instrument at the age of nine under the tutelage of his father and Denise Megevand, a concert harpist. Alan also learned Celtic mythology, art and history as well as the Breton language, traditional Breton dance and the Scottish bagpipe and the bombarde, a traditional Breton instrument, from the oboe family. Alan began playing concerts at eleven years and studying traditional Breton, English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh folk music, also learning the drum, Irish flute, and tin whistle. He competed in and won several Breton traditional music competitions in the Bleimor Pipe band. Alan spent his childhood in Paris, with its cosmopolitan influences from France, Algeria, Morocco and elsewhere. But he fell in love with Breton music and Celtic culture in general, and often went back in his teens to Brittany.

Holt paid debut novelist Jed Rubenfeld $800,000 for The Interpretation of Murder, gave away 10,000 advance-review copies, conducted a major publicity blitz, and did a first printing of 185,000 copies. The book was published almost six months ago, and, at last report, had moved about 26,000 copies. I calculate that Mr. Rubenfeld's unearned portion of the $800,000 is roughly $732,400.
We divied up the three mags among those of us without a closet full of porn hidden at home. My brother found mine and absconded with it within the week which probably saved me trouble later down the road.
But she admitted it's getting increasingly more difficult to keep the campaign going. Neither she nor her partner, Dave Mahon, have been able to work since Amy disappeared, but they have spent a fortune. "How much?" I ask. "Oh, easily over 200,000," she replies. She tells me that Dave was able to check his mobile phone and see that he alone has spent 10,000 on credit for it since January 2008.
Yes, I said spaces. This girl really has it going on, we get to see oodles and oodles of incredible inspiration in one post! It's like Christmas came early this year! Because there was SO much incredible inspiration and ideas, I condensed it some, but I am linking to her posts which contain additional details on her projects, and you will be sucked in. Just sayin'...

The Kingdom of God starts small, a grain of wheat, a mustard seed, a leaven in the loaf. And it spreads, oh, yes, it grows. But it starts small, even hidden in the secret places, a knitting together of wonder, perhaps. A candle on a lamp stand, a woman searching for a coin, a man in a field with a treasure worth selling everything to possess.

Come to think of it, there's really no difference between Mandela and Taylor. Mandela supporters terrorized the black majority into electing him president in 1994, after South Africa had been at war against communist forces since the mid-1960's. Taylor, following a peace deal that ended the Liberian Civil War, also terrorized the population into electing him president in the 1997 general election.
This is an example of churnalism at its laziest worst. Or is it something more sinister? The statement from the court suggested that "Such inventions are a kind of blood libel, and we wonder why the inventor of the story did not continue to describe how we collected the blood of the dog to make our matzah." That might be going too far. But it says a lot about BBC journalism that they imagined that stoning reincarnated dog lawyers to death was the sort of thing Orthodox Jews get up to.

What if they were to do a study to report a finding of clinically obese people who'd take a year or more off their lives for a "perfect" body? Or people with some sort of birth defect? Or - and perhaps most pertinent to my own situation - transsexuals?
There was a problem with Shirley's printer which held up the order slightly and so she was extremely kind and sent me this other Love design as a special surprise, and it's now brightening up the side of my wardrobe. As mentioned before I do not like the wardrobes in my bedroom and they desperately need painting cream but now I see this pretty print instead of the wood and I just adore it. (Sorry for the reflections in the glass!)
Making dumplings is a great way to get over that after-work slump of forgoing the dinner plans and diving into a bag of microwave popcorn (I fully admit to having done this), because even though it takes awhile, it's pretty easy, and I felt like a kid in science class watching an experiment! These two dough logs blow up and get all slimy in a big pot of boiling water. Don't worry, the slime subsides by the time they're ready to eat :)

In the end, we got everything cleaned out and they apartments offered them a new apartment since the condition of the carpet, walls, and just everything in general was in such deplorable condition. I also told them that I wouldn't help them a second time. I don't think I could handle doing something like that more than once. I even refurnished their new place since all their furniture was ruined. T.V., couch, tables and chairs, beds, dressers, etc. I found all of it for them. Most of it was donated and some were my personal things.

In short, this CD is a breathtaking collection of the bands that Acadiana locals go dance to every weekend - though it is not a collection of your Grandfather's Cajun songs. It is a wonderful CD.

I can tell you that I don't hate you, nor does Joan. All that's wanted by either of us is to have you out of her life. Hate has way of aging a person and eating away at them. It will eventually turn back on the person doing the hating, and affect them as much, or more, that it affects the object of that hate. Are you capable of letting go, or are hateful behavior and bullying the only languages you understand?

Needless to say, we didn't run classes that week, but it was interesting to see the areas where we would usually hold yoga classes being used instead for BBQs, and the relaxing quiet poolside area being turned into the local evening rum club!

I've mentioned many reasons for having "photowednesdays" on this blog. some reasons are current events love of Brooklyn and keeping my idle hands from being the devils playthings. I've probably also mentioned it's not always easy to find a new pic of something Brooklyn-centric or born that's interesting. I never want photo Wednesdays to turn into a catalogue of cliched pics of the bridge or the arch.

The crazy thing is that I never shared my passions, not even with my best friends. I think they may have guessed how obsessed I was with Star Wars and old movies. They had no understanding of my desire to be on stage. And I never once told them the name of the boy I had a crush on. At the time, I think I thought it was self-protection. That if my dreams didn't come true, at least no one knew about them, so I didn't have to be ashamed.

Geraldo made a statement that African American & Latino parents should know better than to let their children walk around with hoodies on because people will fear them. That's the hood will give people cause to arrest, frisk and/or harass them. He actually stated that the hoodie was as much to blame for Trayvon's murder as is Zimmerman. Yes, you read that right! This fool not only said, but then he tweeted it! Okay, well guess what? Zimmerman is not a police officer. Trayvon did not need to keep his hands and face in plain view of Zimmerman. Zimmerman sought him out and approached him. Trayvon didn't put his hoodie on until he felt someone following him. Before that he was a teenager walking down the street in a sweatshirt on a cold rainy night. Unless the boy was picking a lock or peering through someone's window, I'm not sure how he falls under a suspicious category. So its actually NOT the hoodie's fault.it's actually the ignorant vigilante's fault this boy is dead!
Covey amplifies his message by means of wide-ranging examples of "third alternative thinkers". There's the local police force that transformed a crime-plagued community by casting off its entrenched "them against us" mentality. Another example tells the tale of a father who, during the course of one extraordinary evening, rescued his daughter from years of clinical depression. Then there's the judge who brought a swift and peaceful end to a massive environmental lawsuit without setting foot in a courtroom.

While I was away, my middle son Tim has completed his college courses at UNCW and has moved home in between starting his internship in Washington DC mid-January. He graduates in May with his degree in Recreation Therapy. He had a nice surprise waiting for me when I pulled into the driveway at 11PM two days before Christmas. The lighted deer and Christmas tree were in the front yard set up and glowing, attached to the Christmas lights lining the front porch my oldest son, Kerry Lee, had helped me put up during the warm spell right after Thanksgiving. Then when I came into the house I saw that Tim had set up and decorated the Christmas tree, hung the Christmas stockings for everyone including the dogs and cats, and had decorated the rest of the house as well! What a blessing!

I guess I'll start with the name in the address bar. For a while now (at least ten years) I've been working on a fantasy series that has recently become more serious to me. One of the main plot devices is a dream world. So, when I went to use the restroom at a truckstop one day and saw this written on the inside of one of the stalls in permanent marker, I knew I had to incorporate it into my story. Now I have a character who manufactures dreams and I am one step closer to getting this story off the ground.
This comparison seems to suggest that contamination in that part of North America was very limited, but since such detailed maps hadn't been created before, it isn't known what the pre-Fukushima values would have been, and if the yellow areas of around 4µR/Hr (about 2 µR/HR more than much of nearby areas) are areas of heightened manmade contamination or a result of natural variation (due to soil type, etc.). According to the report the manmade (artificial isotopes) component is "up to 1500 CPS" (grey area) throughout the mapped area, see next figure, but what precisely that would mean in terms of activity in the soil isn't clarified (or in any case I can figure out from the reports).

What is the proper response to betrayal? Or even the natural response? Jonas' mother shuns her son but, for many, there will be the often kneejerk response to pay the person back: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth and infidelity for infidelity. So they go out and screw the guy's best friend or the first person they meet in a bar. And that's what happens here. Not the best friend, the bar. When Eva finds out exactly what (or, to be more precise, who) her husband has been doing she goes out, picks up a guy in a bar, goes back to his flat and lets him have his way with her.

When I was in Phnom Penh recently, I discovered in the guidebook that there was a cafe called the "Lazy Gecko Cafe". I looked it up on the map and saw that it was quite far from where I was staying and also from most of the areas I would be visiting. However, the pull to seek out this lazy gecko was strong and on my final day, I decided to hunt it down and sink a coffee or two.

Fuck cellphones. How the fuck do we think we're ever going to stay on this planet if we keep pumping so much shit into cellphones. You know what they're doing, right? They're making it so our entire life can be carried on one tiny fucking handheld thing. Imagine that. A monopoly on life itself. I'm waiting for the day when cellphones actually spew out Starbucks coffee. It'll happen. It'll fuckin' HAPPEN.

Sundays are still bittersweet. It's a day off work and the thought of that day starts out glorious but quickly fades when my to-do list fills the whole day. And by the end of a busy day off, I could (and have) easily cry over the thought of returning to work the next morning for another 6 day stretch. But I do whats important. Sundays - there is church, visiting my grandpa, visiting my parents, getting housework done, grocery shopping, making dinner, spending time with Craig and Milo, and preparing for another 60 hour work week. So other than a lighter day at work I'm very much looking forward to the couple 40 hour work weeks I'll get to resume after tax season is over before Grayson arrives.

We'd decided on going to the Cartoon Museum in London when we read about an exhibition of work by one of the greatest cartoonists of all time, H.M. Bateman. He was the man who pioneered short or no-caption drawings which were such a welcome contrast to the rather heavily laboured pieces favoured by the Edwardians and Victorians. He also did fabulous caricatures, but was best known for his series about 'The Man Who.', which included toe-curling embarrassing moments, such as a guardsman who dropped his rifle on parade and a junior officer who ate the colonel's starter at a regimental dinner. He did superb irate older men with popping monocles and incandescent eye-brows. We both laughed outright many times in the exhibition - and nobody went Shhhhh. It's a great place: very cheap to get in, an excellent shop and the show itself was superb: very well-lit and arranged and with full, detailed captions. I can report that the Cartoon Museum hasn't caught the almost universal disease of British museums who seem to think their visitors are either ill-informed half-wits, or pre-school children.

There was that time I watched my father in a televised drama where he was portraying yet another down and out character. There was a part where he was cold and shivering and sad, and I am told I came out from under the dining table that was my favourite hiding spot and offered my blankie to the television set saying "Here daddy, you can have my blankie, you don't have to be cold!" The adults thought that was the sweetest, funniest thing ever, but to my four year old mind, my father was suffering and I wanted to help. I knew he was pretending, but could I be really, really sure he wasn't actually cold?

The good folks at BulkAmmo.com sent along not only the reduced recoil Rio loads, but also some Sellier & Bellot standard buck, and some S&B 3" magnum buckshot as well. The three loads nicely stack into a good comparison of reduced recoil loads vs. standard, and the 3" magnum shells add a 'spice' to the mix.
Then finally, they put me on depakote. I am mentioning this drug by name because I have heard from several other women that they believe depakote was the cause of this for them too, and a doctor at a California University said that he strongly, strongly believes that it gives PCOS to young women. Then I heard that some doctors have been instructed not to prescribe it to women under 40. Depakote won't own up to that and they knowingly let the doctors prescribe it (at least, until recently from what I hear). I don't want to get into who my sources are because I don't want to get anyone in trouble. It's very good for seizures, my brother had to take it for years and it kept him alive, but for Bipolar- not so much.

This book was emotional, and sometimes hard to read. But it was Lisa's lyrical and poetic style of writing that made me stay reading the story. I really loved Janie's character and I thought that throughout the series, she's really grown to accept who she is and what she can do.

When we allow ourselves to let go of wanting the other to fill us up, when we let ourselves be real, as we are, another energy comes through our body and being. It will charge our entire being with a presence, a force that is absolutely free of wanting. We feel open, grounded, free, humble and powerful - zero and everything. It is as through our body, heart and soul simultaneously flower in reverential awe of the moment. This force is an exquisite expression of the flower of life itself.

With the spread of pornography, and at the same time a dramatic increase in the production of adult literature (i.e. immoral literature), came a basically simultaneous liberalization of obscenity laws, often through judicial interpretation. . . .

If I had a majority of 29 seats in Parliament and me and my ministers were actually "Serving the People", I'd have nothing to worry about..I wouldn't need to hold 3 public meetings in one week, deploy hundreds of people on websites and generally look like I've been caught with my underwear around my ankles!

Drifting refers to a driving technique and to a motorsport where the driver intentionally over steers, causing loss of traction in the rear wheels through turns, while maintaining vehicle control and a high exit speed. A car is drifting when the rear slip angle is greater than the front slip angle prior to the corner apex, and the front wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or vice versa), and the driver is controlling these factors. As a motor sport, professional drifting competitions are held worldwide. Drift challenges drivers to navigate a course in a sustained sideslip by exploiting coupled nonlinearities in the tire force response.

If there was an award for courage in the cricketing world, it should very well be named after Bob Willis. When he was 26, he had operations on both his knees, which meant he was in constant pain whenever he played. In fact, on certain days, he needed to run five miles in order to generate the strength to play. It was only through his will that Willis managed to play and succeed at the top level for nine more years. At 6 feet 6 inches, Willis was an intimidating fast bowler, one of the fastest England have ever produced. His pace, bounce, aggression and swing made him deadly on all kinds of pitches across the world.

The key to this entire problem was failure to understand Paul's ministry and message. Were Lysius to side with the Jews, he would be as lost as they. Fortunately, he had Paul in a semi-private audience. The Jews no longer had a gospel message for God was no longer dealing with them. To Paul was given the gospel of the grace of God for so we read in Ephesians 3:2.
After Hal kills Hotspur, he eulogizes him thus:
Yet let us analyze these implications in their general form. Starting with an increase in extreme weather, the erosion of soils and weak rock will increase. This will cause more of the imposing landmasses to crumble into the sea leading to an even greater rise in sea level. The changes will exponentially become more and more unpredictable. A chaotic patter will emerge which can never be studied. People will panic, but the plain fact is that nature is beyond their control. Sea levels will rise, temperatures will spike, and weather will be out of control. Everything will seem to be pointing toward an inevitable apocalypse.
Can you tell from my reviews recently that it is getting colder outside? I truly love this time of year for beer. Don't get me wrong I love a good APA or IPA in the summer, but even more I enjoy a fine stout or porter during the colder months of the year. I've got a few bottles of this beer and this is my first one in a very long time for review. I am enjoying this beer while watching my Alma Mater Ball State keep their win streak alive against Miami of Ohio.
While I was away, my middle son Tim has completed his college courses at UNCW and has moved home in between starting his internship in Washington DC mid-January. He graduates in May with his degree in Recreation Therapy. He had a nice surprise waiting for me when I pulled into the driveway at 11PM two days before Christmas. The lighted deer and Christmas tree were in the front yard set up and glowing, attached to the Christmas lights lining the front porch my oldest son, Kerry Lee, had helped me put up during the warm spell right after Thanksgiving. Then when I came into the house I saw that Tim had set up and decorated the Christmas tree, hung the Christmas stockings for everyone including the dogs and cats, and had decorated the rest of the house as well! What a blessing!

So, adoptive families must be more exact with their questions, since many of them probably would argue that baby-buying is corruption. Instead of asking, "Do you feel there is wide-spread corruption in China's program?" a better question might be "Do you feel that paying substantial amounts of money for children is adoption corruption? And how wide-spread do you feel this baby-buying is?" It may be that he hedges, like the villager in the opening story, out of a reluctance to air China's dirty laundry, for there is one characteristic of the Chinese that I understand very well, having lived with one for seven years: The Chinese do not like to reveal the dirty secrets of their country, even to friends. It is a tradition and understanding that goes back hundreds of years. We might view it as lying, but the Chinese consider it "saving face."

All of the above started flying at me through the phone. Remember, she's never even met him or seen the amount of vomit coming out of him. The last two weeks had already been filled with her judgments about everything from where he was sleeping and how many times we'd left the house. SHE was stressing me out and that isn't helping for milk supply either.
Roger Webster, who gives a rather simplistic view of the historical facts in his bedside book - "The Illustrated at the Fireside - Pg 56", gives some insight into how it came about that the British press of that time managed to frame Hermanus Potgieter as a rogue and a villain. At that time the Volksraad of the Transvaal had passed a law prohibiting barter with the local people, under a penalty of £37.10. The object of the law ---- now listen carefully, ---- was to keep the peace! The fact that someone was going to make lots of money was beside the point!
I also feel a change coming in me. I prefer to stay at home, or go for a quiet dinner, or watch a movie. I don't like clubbing anymore, or going and getting "wasted" which is what most of my friends do. Nothing wrong with that at all. But I am just not there anymore. My idea of a good night out now is relaxing at home with a good movie, or going to a cinema, or cooking dinner, or going out to eat. If alcohol must be involved, a nice quiet bar where we can sit and talk.
This story focuses on John, a man that works for the government. One day he finds himself tied to a chair in an interrogation room. He doesn't know why he's there or what they want, but he does know one thing; he's not talking. As his interrogators try to coax information out of him he fades in and out of consciousness and reminisces on his life. Will he find a way to escape? Does he even want to?

I'm a bit down/depressed because of the car stuff. Clint & I didn't sleep very well this weekend or eat very much so now all I want to do is munch on some cookies I baked earlier and try to relax a little before I have to go to work in the morning.
After passing a few awful sicknesses back and forth we are ready for spring more than ever! Today was chilly but the sun was shining and the birds were chirping...so it's coming. This past weekend I put the remainder of the "winter" decorations away and made room for a couple new springy plants.
For to long to mention there have been a few hair accessories that needed some attention. They have been sitting on the kitchen counter being moved from one spot to the next. I keep finding a reason to put off this task. After moving them for the thousandth time I finally pulled out the glue gun to get it done.

It's been a while - since December, in fact - since I pulled out the brew equipment. Well, with the return of summer, and my recently purchased, though not yet assembled MLT, the time has come to make some beer. Now, the little Brew Devil inside of me is pulling me in a few different ways, and I have a couple of obligations to previously conjured brews, so the brew schedule is filling up fast. Here's a quick run down.
J had an egg scramble with bacon, mushroom and sausage which also looked good. It was a lovely cosy atmosphere with little booths and squishy chairs. The meal for both of us, with 3 drinks, was only $30 which was great.
Seems to be the case that for some reason, the Left (as I'll call them here), have been brainwashed into thinking the EDL are a violent Nazi group. My experience is that it's the UAF that are against free speech, human rights and are willing to let this country go to the dogs! If you believe in democracy, why do you protest at anybody else's parade, demo or whatever?

Audrey subsequently suffered a heart attack, brought on in part by the stress of dealing with her feud with David over the ownership of what was formerly her hair salon. She had earlier signed over her interest in the salon to David, as she intended to elope with Lewis Archer (Nigel Havers) and to buy a hotel in Greece. She now wants the salon back.

You want Cookie to love and forgive. Okay. She has. That's her nature... her character... her faith. She also knows the difference between a wicked action and a loving action and that those girls and mothers have freely chosen the former. It is not her fault. It is out of her hands. She makes a note of how not to treat others. Prays for them. And moves on.

Such determination in her work life goes hand in hand with sacrifices in her social life. She often finds herself declining invites to parties or social gatherings in favour of a few more hours sewing or attending a networking event. When this happens, Judith simply reminds herself "Well they are only drinking wine, I'm not really missing out on that much". This sort of perspective has helped her throughout her career.
And so I began. I used the instructions I found online as my chief guide but after three days I was a little skeptical that the sour dough had fermented enough or produced enough yeast. My Twitter friend Finn said that he had been feeding his starter ("Veruca") for 12 days and it was now time. So I asked him if he thought my starter was ready? He confirmed what I thought and said no. So I've been letting "Finn Jr". grow and grow. Last night he became a rebellious teenager and we woke up to him trying to escape the safety of his jar to explore the world (thus the picture above this posting).
During the evenings the crickets and cicadas sing. Combined with roosters, hens, ducks, wild birds, yowling skinny cats and the nightly chorus sent up by the campus's dog population this can all add up to quite the racket at bed time. Speaking of ducks, on my walk home from the office yesterday a tiny yellow duckling waddled across the open-air hallway I was threading my way through, looking lost yet determined. I hope he's found his way to safety, it's a jungle out there.
Meet Samantha. But we hardly ever call her that. Mostly, we call her Little D. That's D, for Diva. Because it's all about her. After a long weekend visiting family in Pennsylvania, we came home and adopted her at the humane society. There, she was named Thelma. You can plainly see that name just didn't suit her. (Actually, I wanted to name her Tootsie and the hubby wanted to name her Tarot. Then I jokingly suggested Samantha because she was being a little naughty at the time - she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter. Anyway, I said to my hubby that we should call her Samantha because "naughty girls need love too". Ha. What can I say, I was a teenager in the 80s.)

This is an example of churnalism at its laziest worst. Or is it something more sinister? The statement from the court suggested that "Such inventions are a kind of blood libel, and we wonder why the inventor of the story did not continue to describe how we collected the blood of the dog to make our matzah." That might be going too far. But it says a lot about BBC journalism that they imagined that stoning reincarnated dog lawyers to death was the sort of thing Orthodox Jews get up to.

Then finally, they put me on depakote. I am mentioning this drug by name because I have heard from several other women that they believe depakote was the cause of this for them too, and a doctor at a California University said that he strongly, strongly believes that it gives PCOS to young women. Then I heard that some doctors have been instructed not to prescribe it to women under 40. Depakote won't own up to that and they knowingly let the doctors prescribe it (at least, until recently from what I hear). I don't want to get into who my sources are because I don't want to get anyone in trouble. It's very good for seizures, my brother had to take it for years and it kept him alive, but for Bipolar- not so much.

But even getting out officially isn't easy. I believe that the US and its allies don't really give a tinker's curse about Afghanistan; as far as they are concerned, if the Afghans are intent on living in a barbaric medieval theocracy, where women are treated as chattels, those who don't share the faith of the rulers live in fear of death, and there're more or less continual low-level wars between various tribes, then they're welcome to do so. Admittedly, there is the poppy problem - Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of non-pharmaceutical grade opiates (92% in 2007) and also, incidentally, the world's largest producer of hashish - but, despite all the hype about the so-called War on Drugs, I have a feeling that (for all sorts of reasons, many sordid, which I won't go into here) the US and most other countries can live with that. No, the real problems are the two 500 pound

Step 2 - Drop and Bake: Drop batter by tablespoon onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in a well pre-heated 350º F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Do not over-bake. Cookies should be a bit gooey in the center. While warm, they will be very soft on the outside, as well. Allow them to cool on the pan a few minutes and then transfer carefully to a rack to finish cooling. (They will always be somewhat soft because these are gooey fudge brownie cookies, not hard or crunchy cookies.)

I really wanted to give the quilter the ability to use their stash but also allow them to go shopping. Who wouldn't want to have some of the newest cutest fabrics in their scrap quilt? It was VERY HARD for me to STOP buying fabric. I kept telling myself, "Ooooh! Wouldn't this be cute? I have to have a bit of this!" I actually used over 150+ fabrics in this quilt. I hope you have fun playing with your stash and adding the newest cutest fabrics to your quilt.

Maybe Facebook should hire Thomas Friedman to do its ads. His ad for Coursera (h/t Indyanna's comment at Historiann's) column on online education pretty much explains why the 100,000-person online class and the flipped classroom, with local professors as glorified tutors, is the way to go. The comments are good, and they ask the same questions we've all been asking and come to some similar conclusions.
In a town where the economy has largely collapsed, the project of connecting local small food-producers with consumers in nearby cities is motivated more by the possibility of job creation than it is by pursuit of culinary nirvana.

I found one that's definitely a keeper. Simple Food for Busy Families: The Whole Life Nutrition Approach is a fabulous resource with step-by-step instructions on how to turn your family's bad eating habits around. The first half of the book addresses everything from getting enough sleep to why it makes sense to eat seasonal food. Each section gives practical tips on how to implement changes slowly in your family's routine so that eventually you're eating better and feeling better.

The fact that it's almost Cinco de Mayo got me thinking about, well, of all things, Cinco de Mayo. In high school I lived about two hours north of the Mexican border in West Covina, California. Being a suburb of L.A., there were a number of easy access attractions available to young people including Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm (amazing pies and fried chicken), the famed Southern California beaches where I spent most of my summers, the San Diego Zoo and Tijuana, or T.J. as we referred to it.

Admiral Ororod did not garner the complete respect of those under him; he had connections, came from a well-to-do family with important political ties, more a bureaucrat with aspirations for a political career than a military career, he ran his detachment more like a business than the military unit it was. He may have been far from the most inspirational of fleet officers, but his politically minded motivations also helped to ensure that the Orion was one of the top training vessels in all the fleet.

But going down through the water to touch the wild man at the bottom of the pond is quite a different matter. The being who stands up is frightening, and he seems even more so now, when corporations do so much work to produce the sanitized, hairless shallow man (2) That's poor Viggo in THE ROAD, a sanitized man re-bearded, trying to be wild in a wild land, having to re-learn the role of the deep, dark masculine and getting it incorrect. No reflection on Viggo, of course, who showed he can bring that shit hardcore in the RINGS films and HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. It's more I think the head-on craftsmanshippy approach to the McCarthy novel -- it gets it too right, maybe, to work. Teardrop on the other hand is the untamed wild man, the kind of guy that creeps you out at first but then somewhere along the way, not sure when, you start to admire him. Isn't that so much better, children, than the other way around? (Beards of Bleakness: WINTER'S BONE VS. THE ROAD)

Schirmbeck on Wednesday filed a formal complaint over the matter with Galveston County District Attorney Jack Roady. He also asked for an investigation into whether the city's use of public funds on pro-camera advertising on the public access television channel 16 and on the city's website violates state election law. In November, residents will have a chance to vote on whether to continue the photo ticketing program. Schirmbeck believes the slick video material was produced by Redflex, but the commercials did not disclose their true origin, in violation of state campaign laws.

The mean average is where a random variable is most likely to land. The further you stray from the mean, the less likely you are to find something landing that far out. So, any kid who scored highly is much more likely to come closer to the 25% mean average next time.

Funny business this children-thing. My only (somewhat incoherent) conclusion is that you must do what you must do and get on with it the very best you can.
Well, we never made that myrtle. The problem wasn't the hogs busting us. It was the coyote. One old mangy dog was loitering around the herd. These pigs were big enough not to be bothered by a pesky song dog, but they certainly took notice of him after he caught wind of our activities and bounded away. The coup de grace, though, were the turkeys. A couple hens were holding sentry and naturally took off when they saw us, taking the finally-frightened hogs with them. Wild pigs don't have the best sense of sight, but they're wary enough to recognize something amiss. (And how strange is it to find a coyote, hogs, and turkeys hanging around each other outside of a Disney movie?)

When was the last time you gave your windows any attention? Last week? Last month? Last year? Its spring and a great time to have a "cleaning" challenge. This week I am challenging you to open up the drapes, pull up the blinds, and let the sunshine in! We are going to be washing the windows! Throughout the rest of April, we will be concentrating on spring cleaning during the weekly challenges. Its always more fun cleaning with others.
Come to think of it, there's really no difference between Mandela and Taylor. Mandela supporters terrorized the black majority into electing him president in 1994, after South Africa had been at war against communist forces since the mid-1960's. Taylor, following a peace deal that ended the Liberian Civil War, also terrorized the population into electing him president in the 1997 general election.
Before I get lost in embarrassingly worshipful paeans about the pieces on Axl Rose ("with the wasp-man sunglasses and the braids and the goatee, he reminds one of the monster in Predator, or of that monster's wife on its home planet") and Michael Jackson ("a god moves through him; the god enters, the god leaves") and the rest, let me stop and explain.

She co-produced the Emmy-winning documentary Fire and Ice: The Winter War of Finland and Russia and holds a Ph.D. in the History of Ideas from Aarhus University in Denmark.

The point of cleavage between those who hold the crude theory of Baptismal regeneration, ex opere operato, and those who maintain what is usually spoken of as the "Hypothetical Theory," lies just here. The former believe that the recital of a formula and the performance of a particular action necessarily produce the spiritual effect of regeneration; the latter hold that where believing prayer is offered for a blessing, which we have reason to believe it is God's will to grant, that prayer will be provisionally answered. The former believe that this spiritual result is absolute, and admits of being neither reversed nor supplemented; the latter maintain that the result, whatever it is, must needs be provisional in its character, and cannot be made absolute until the condition upon which in the case of an adult it is contingent is complied with. The former maintain that the saving effect of this ordinance may be lost by wilful sin; the latter maintain that such saving effects only remain if the condition on which they are contingent is complied with, and, even where wilful sin does not occur, are forfeited by the non-fulfilment of the appointed condition. According to the former theory, no baptized member of our congregations needs to be born again, or, indeed, can be, although his life may be a discredit to our common humanity, and it would seem that the only hope for him lay in the possibility of so radical a change ; according to the other, all who have never consciously exercised faith in the special promise of God made in Baptism need to be told, "Ye must be born again." The difference between the two positions, which may seem to be slight, is really radical. The Gorham judgment given on appeal by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council affirmed that the hypothetical explanation of the formularies of the Church of England was a perfectly reasonable and legitimate one, though it did not affirm that it was the only possible interpretation. See GORHAM CASE.

Even though it was quite disappointing for we the children, the parents especially the mothers were happy because it spared them the trouble of waking up at dawn to cook the Ampesi, Banku, Konkonte, Mpotopoto, Tuo Zaafi (Ghanaian dishes). Did I hear you say, you sent the Fried Rice and Chicken, Potato chips and Chicken and burgers? Hmm, my dear friend, this was what I dreamt of sending to Our Day. Nevertheless, Our Day was still fun. There were lots of toffees, chocolate, biscuits, cookies, drinks and delicious food from the school's canteen. The one who made my Our Day always memorable was one of my favourite teachers, Mr. Quartey. He was my class 5 teacher. He loved to pamper me and my squad (P.I.A - don't ask for the meaning). It wasn't that we were teachers' pets but... aha we had favour from our teachers.

But even getting out officially isn't easy. I believe that the US and its allies don't really give a tinker's curse about Afghanistan; as far as they are concerned, if the Afghans are intent on living in a barbaric medieval theocracy, where women are treated as chattels, those who don't share the faith of the rulers live in fear of death, and there're more or less continual low-level wars between various tribes, then they're welcome to do so. Admittedly, there is the poppy problem - Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of non-pharmaceutical grade opiates (92% in 2007) and also, incidentally, the world's largest producer of hashish - but, despite all the hype about the so-called War on Drugs, I have a feeling that (for all sorts of reasons, many sordid, which I won't go into here) the US and most other countries can live with that. No, the real problems are the two 500 pound

I was pleasantly surprised to find the quality of items such as fruits and meat to be just what I would have picked. The bananas aren't too ripe and the clementines look fine.

I'm not prepared for the breaking down of my best friend, for the suffering and slow burn of flames licking at all she holds dear, her light and her laughter and her little family, her safe haven and her confidence. I'm not sure if I'm willing to drag her through this with me.

Meet Samantha. But we hardly ever call her that. Mostly, we call her Little D. That's D, for Diva. Because it's all about her. After a long weekend visiting family in Pennsylvania, we came home and adopted her at the humane society. There, she was named Thelma. You can plainly see that name just didn't suit her. (Actually, I wanted to name her Tootsie and the hubby wanted to name her Tarot. Then I jokingly suggested Samantha because she was being a little naughty at the time - she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter. Anyway, I said to my hubby that we should call her Samantha because "naughty girls need love too". Ha. What can I say, I was a teenager in the 80s.)

As stated in his book "The Leadership Engine", Tichy Noel reinforces that learning is a key requirement for developing leadership. We enhance our unique qualities through learning and education. Studying abroad was probably one of the richest experiences of my life. It was a privilege to study for my MBA at Duke, The Fuqua School of Business. It was a unique moment of my life. The globally focused education allowed me to make a deep personal assessment while providing me with an actionable set of global leadership tools. (Not to mention that I met my wife during my MBA, this is awesome).

When they were little, Walt Disney would take his two young daughters, Diane and Sharon, to play at the carousel at Griffith Park in Los Angeles every Sunday. While his daughters enjoyed their repeated rides, Disney sat on park benches with the other parents who had nothing to do but watch. It was on these Sunday excursions that Walt Disney began to dream of an activity park that had things for both children and parents to do.

Mum had Darcy and i was still getting ready to get in and Jordy is off! Little bugger. I was a bit worried about him going over the edge of the waterfall but i met him down the end and he kicked over to me. Not that it was a big waterfall!

Let me tell you, I previously loved Gerard Butler's Phantom but Ramin Karimloo's Phantom made me want to hop through my television set, kick Christine out of the picture and run away with him on the streets of Paris. He was AMAZING with a gorgeous voice and so much raw, sexy emotion. Despite kicking her to the side for the Phantom the gorgeous Sierra Boggess was an awesome Christine with an amazingly hypnotic voice. The height of the play where they sang the theme song was filled with such romance and emotion. I also fell in love with the Music of the Night from Ramin's emotionally raw and sexy voice. I had to grab the soundtrack after to relive the experience over and over again. I simply fell in love with the production!
But, "We remain cautious about pronouncing a turnaround until we observe a couple more quarters of improvement," said Reis. "As we have observed in the recent past, two consecutive quarters of improvement are not necessarily the beginning of a trend and are insufficient to declare that a recovery is underway."
For this also there is no technological or large-scale solution. Perhaps, as they believe, the most conscientiously up-to-date people can easily do without local workshops and stores, local journalism, a local newspaper, a local post office, all of which supposedly have been replaced by technologies. But what technology can replace personal privacy or the coherence of a family or a community? What technology can undo the collateral damages of an inhuman rate of technological change?
This is really just basic scientific competence. If we can't notice the stuff in some way, then believing that it exists is pointless. And if we can notice it, then we should be able to make sure it is where we think it is. If we back it into a corner, it won't vanish into the aether, like the aether did.
It is nearly impossible to engender the necessary confidence, trust and loyalty a leader must possess without being fully engaged. A leader spends as much time out of the confines of the office engaging in real conversation with people as they do in their office planning, decision-making and organizing. Whether in person, over the phone, via email, through the social web, or even by sending a good old fashion "thank you" note - be an engaging conversationalist.
In 1982, Björk fell in with Stifgrim, a freeform rock-jazz (as oposed to jazz- rock) duo, comprimising guitarist Steinn Skaptason and vocalist/stand-up comedian Kristinn Jon Gudmundsson. Her sole gig with the band was a part of Iceland's bid to get into the 'Guinness Book Of Records' for the longest ever continuous live performance. Nearly one hundred bands took part in the event, which lasted several weeks, each playing for anything up to twelve hours. Björk's effort was recorded for posterity, and a choice 90-minute 'Best Of' recording of Stifgrim's world-record bid apparently survives on cassette. A week after this occasion, Björk was involved in one other Stifgrim-related event, where she accompanied Kristinn Jon Gudmundsson on guitar as he crooned his way through "Love Me Tender".

We'd decided on going to the Cartoon Museum in London when we read about an exhibition of work by one of the greatest cartoonists of all time, H.M. Bateman. He was the man who pioneered short or no-caption drawings which were such a welcome contrast to the rather heavily laboured pieces favoured by the Edwardians and Victorians. He also did fabulous caricatures, but was best known for his series about 'The Man Who.', which included toe-curling embarrassing moments, such as a guardsman who dropped his rifle on parade and a junior officer who ate the colonel's starter at a regimental dinner. He did superb irate older men with popping monocles and incandescent eye-brows. We both laughed outright many times in the exhibition - and nobody went Shhhhh. It's a great place: very cheap to get in, an excellent shop and the show itself was superb: very well-lit and arranged and with full, detailed captions. I can report that the Cartoon Museum hasn't caught the almost universal disease of British museums who seem to think their visitors are either ill-informed half-wits, or pre-school children.

I guess I'll start with the name in the address bar. For a while now (at least ten years) I've been working on a fantasy series that has recently become more serious to me. One of the main plot devices is a dream world. So, when I went to use the restroom at a truckstop one day and saw this written on the inside of one of the stalls in permanent marker, I knew I had to incorporate it into my story. Now I have a character who manufactures dreams and I am one step closer to getting this story off the ground.

All that and more is depicted in movies such as Gods and Generals, the miniseries North and South, or many books including the Bernard Cornwell novel of 1993, The Rebel, in his the Starbuck Chronicles series.

Given NuLabour's visceral hatred and contempt for the white working class, who's interests so often conflicts with those now much preferred groups, many observers would have assumed that Denham was either making a bad joke and had forgotten the punchline, or was suffering from some catastrophic mental breakdown, had they, that is, not realised that an election is imminent.

This book was emotional, and sometimes hard to read. But it was Lisa's lyrical and poetic style of writing that made me stay reading the story. I really loved Janie's character and I thought that throughout the series, she's really grown to accept who she is and what she can do.
Of course, it's unlikely that anyone will call The Times out on using this kind of rabble-rousing tabloid language. Who would seriously defend "racist scum" (an expression which, incidentally, is only ever associated with one particular race group)?
On days that I need to complete a lot I will set my timer for 15 minutes and work on one task for the full 15 minutes. I will stop that task when the timer goes off and move on to another task. This usually happens on good days, where the pain is tolerable. I will work on one task, for example, clearing clutter in one room, then I move to 15 minutes doing computer work, then 15 minutes cleaning a focus zone, then 15 minutes reading. I try to alternate from something physical to something sedentary, and including a 15 minute "break" every third 15 minute session. This is what I call my 15 minute day, and I find that I am most productive these days.

The Princess and the Pea by Hans Christian Anderson
Almost the exact middle, actually. Young and school-trained London singer Woon's debut album, Mirrorwriting, sits between Katy B and James B, pop theatricality and singer-songwriter calm, club culture and bedroom indie, old-school soul and modern electronic R&B, extroverted and introverted. And tying it all together is the language of UK bass. His first major single, 2010's justly lauded "Night Air", announced him as one of a number of young English artists for whom garage, and everything that came after, was just another bit of pop language to use. And from the slow-motion jungle syncopations and muted bass blare of "Street" to the stuttering retro-rave breakbeats that drive "Spirits", the computer-assisted Woon makes sorta-pop from the last 20 years of UK dance the way current U.S. guitar kids draw from surf-rock and girl-groups.

Yeah. This is most definitely going to be a challenge. I'm thinking about posting this photo on fb and suggesting it's food. It's somewhat believable - I do hail from the deep South. So wrong. So, so wrong. I meant, me.

Reaching goals requires motivation. ZenHabits does a nice job of explaining motivation, as well as ways to achieve it and sustain it during times of struggle. To find out more about motivation, check out the self-motivation quiz from Mindtools. After the quiz, there is a nice explanation of factors involved in self-motivation including: self-confidence and efficacy, positive thinking, focus, and environment. The author from the article How Self-Motivated Are You noted, "Self-motivation doesn't come naturally to everyone. And even those who are highly self-motivated need some extra help every now and then. Build your self-motivation by practicing goal-setting skills, and combining those with positive thinking, the creation of powerful visions of success, and the building of high levels of self-efficacy and self-confidence."

The comments are good, and they ask the same questions we've all been asking and come to some similar conclusions.

It's been a while - since December, in fact - since I pulled out the brew equipment. Well, with the return of summer, and my recently purchased, though not yet assembled MLT, the time has come to make some beer.

I spent this past weekend at a retreat at the Seabeck Conference Center. I had to smile as I drove into Seabeck. The business district, if I don't count the Conference Center, consists of only about a half a dozen buildings, but when I arrived in town I was greeted by a small gray building with a bright blue door. White trim around the window caused the red "Espresso" sign to pop. I decided to go inside. The usual rows of flavors were lined up on a shelf; an espresso machine and a barista were visible from behind a tiny counter. Five or six wooden stools filled the remaining floor space- stools that were all occupied by the locals. They are a generous lot. I discovered that they will tease anyone. They didn't penalize me for being a visitor; locals and visitors are all teased alike.

According to this reliable hadith, the cursing of a Muslim constitutes moral depravity. When any Muslim dares to curse another Muslim, this amounts to moral depravity - all the more so when it is done by a scholar, who is considered by some to be a source of authority in Islamic law. He dares to curse, to slander, to make unfounded accusations, and to sanction the killing, execution, and stoning of people. He uses black incitement against a Muslim. This is the height of moral depravity.

Her blog is full of shopping tidbits, interiors, and many other things but my favorite part about her blog is all of the personal touches she adds. You should see how she decorated her laundry room and how gorgeous her wedding was. But seriously, if you haven't seen them go right now. Thank you again Katie, you're the best!
Parts of the country are already drier than they were in the summer of 1976, when Britain experienced its worst drought for more than 100 years. Then water shortages led to standpipes being installed on residential streets, water supplies to businesses being rationed and schools having to close early.

All edges were coloured with Memento green dye ink applied with cut'n'dry foam. The bottom panels were first trimmed out of Kraft card and then matted with the pink paper.and stuck in place as shown. The main panel on the plaque was put together similarly but before attaching was stamped with a moth stamp (PaperArtsy) in Archival black ink and embellished with a diecut (Nestabilities) tag with pink panel and another 'Smile' stamp (PaperArtsy). The roses were applied at the base on foam pads. A piece of 3 mm dark green satin ribbon was tied through the hole in the tag and a piece of black numbers Washi tape applied before sticking in place.

We've done a load of work at the White Horse previously (see Rounds 1, 2, 3, 4) but we were asked back to go over a wall that we've done previously (that was looking a little grubby due to the addition of some low-grade graffiti), freshen up the gents toilet door, take care of a tall wall beside the bar and also throw in a few little extras scattered around the place. The White Horse is one of our favourite local boozers so working there is always good fun and design-wise we've obviously run with the whole White Horse identity but given it a little id-iom twist.

The aroma was filled with the recognizable smell of Smith and Cross: strong, funky and full of promise. Of course the molasses was there as well, though I am still not sure if I was smelling the actual molasses or the Smith and Cross. Also, the pineapple spear, which was an utter garnish failure, awkward protuberance that it was, added a bit of undefinable fruitiness to the nose. The first sip was very molasses-y, though the hogo of the rum carried through at the end. You would think that there would be some sweetness in this drink, but it was dry and earthy, with a vague powdery texture that made each sip seem almost chewy. After I increased the bitters, the spices became more detectable on the swallow. The flavors of the molasses were also enhanced by the increase in bitters--the drink seemed sweeter, in that pleasing molasses cookie way, and the flavors in general seemed more balanced. Overall, not bad but not great.
I first saw this H&M snake-embossed envelope clutch weeks ago at a location in the city, fell in love (who would've thought since I hate snakes?!), but passed because I didn't have my 20% coupon with me. Days later, when I was ready to actually buy, I couldn't find it anywhere in the stores near me. This is what I get for wanting to save $4 lol. I was about to give up when I recently revisited one of the stores and saw they had restocked. Hallelujah!
One of Geras' guest writers is British professor Eve Garrard, who in her latest post takes on writers Fintan O'Toole, from Ireland, and Iain Banks, from the UK. OK, none of these people is particularly famous as a Middle East commenter, but I'm concerned about arguments, especially when they're often repeated in essentially the same form. Garrard:
Hall then drove down the street, turned around, came back at the victims and ran down the woman, according to the sheriff's office.
It reminds me of the first day he started primary school (but so much worse). He was well adjusted, happy, so ready and all smiles. I was all smiles on the outside also but came home and sobbed a million tears. A time of change and also no other littlies at home to focus on as had been my hope and dream.

The sheer random chance of such an encounter was part of the danger inherent in the setting. On the other hand, you could encounter a group of giant rats or one cave bear by itself. There needs to be more random elements to things while providing players, in the option of the stone giants, with the opportunity to retreat if and when needed.

Meet Samantha. But we hardly ever call her that. Mostly, we call her Little D. That's D, for Diva. Because it's all about her. After a long weekend visiting family in Pennsylvania, we came home and adopted her at the humane society. There, she was named Thelma. You can plainly see that name just didn't suit her. (Actually, I wanted to name her Tootsie and the hubby wanted to name her Tarot. Then I jokingly suggested Samantha because she was being a little naughty at the time - she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter and I put her back down she jumps up on the counter. Anyway, I said to my hubby that we should call her Samantha because "naughty girls need love too". Ha. What can I say, I was a teenager in the 80s.)

This story focuses on John, a man that works for the government. One day he finds himself tied to a chair in an interrogation room. He doesn't know why he's there or what they want, but he does know one thing; he's not talking. As his interrogators try to coax information out of him he fades in and out of consciousness and reminisces on his life. Will he find a way to escape? Does he even want to?

Sometimes when you plan a project, it doesn't go exactly as expected. In keeping with my writing goals for 2011 I planned to write and publish this book in four months. It actually took 12.
For this also there is no technological or large-scale solution. Perhaps, as they believe, the most conscientiously up-to-date people can easily do without local workshops and stores, local journalism, a local newspaper, a local post office, all of which supposedly have been replaced by technologies. But what technology can replace personal privacy or the coherence of a family or a community? What technology can undo the collateral damages of an inhuman rate of technological change?
Hamas leader Khaled Mash'al: "The support we got from Sheikh Al-Qaradhawi is different from the support of anybody else, because of his religious status, his status in terms of morale, and his ability to draw the attention of the nation and the world to the issues of the nation, particularly the issue of Palestine. This support was of great value to us, to the Palestinian people, in the first and second Intifadas, and in all matters pertaining to the Palestinian cause. He has publicly declared his support for the resistance factions, unequivocally and without any hesitation or embarrassment, without fawning over anyone. From day one to the present, the sheikh, may Allah reward him, has not hesitate to support the jihad and the resistance, and to support the fighters, and the resistance factions. One of the most notable manifestations of this support was when we relied - after Allah - on his support of martyrdom operations. He never hesitated to issue rulings in support of these operations, and there were times when we were in dire need of these rulings."

As we approached Shoreditch, I spotted this building. I couldn't see a date on it but it looks Victorian. A deliciously extravagant design, this pub was once called Ye Olde Axe but the name has been painted over and the swinging sign has all but lost its paintwork. The building looks neglected and in need of repair, like something out of a Gothic horror film. An illuminated sign on the side reads "Striptease". Unsurprisingly, the clock no longer works. It is very sad to see buildings like this being allowed to fall into a state of neglected disrepair.

Having just been exposed to tombs, mummies and the world of Hatshepsut full-throttle in a middle school text book, it seemed more fitting than ever to face the crowds and potential chaos with three kids ages 6 - 11, all in the name of seeing the real thing. And, with no more strollers or diapers to consider, it was well worth the attempt.
The Rally Fighter was prototyped in the workshop at the back of the Wareham office, but manufacturing muscle also came from Factory Five Racing, a kit-car company and Local Motors investor located just down the road. Of course, the kit-car business has been around for decades, standing as a proof of concept for how small manufacturing can work in the car industry. Kit cars combine hand-welded steel tube chassis and fiberglass bodies with stock engines and accessories. Amateurs assemble the cars at their homes, which exempts the vehicles from many regulatory restrictions (similar to home-built experimental aircraft). Factory Five has sold about 8,000 kits to date.

Our personal psychology is how our karmic patterns show up in this lifetime. A general Buddhist or Hindu perspective on karma suggests that the individual soul moves through consciousness lifetime after lifetime, incarnating again and again in the school of life in order to complete various tasks and lessons, and to release contractions of consciousness.
You know how sometimes you just feel grouchy as all get-out? For no reason? Sure, if you're female and somewhere between puberty and the end of menopause, you can blame it on hormones.

The biggest thing is with Oldest and her boyfriends daughter, who's 3. The mom just up and left for the 4th time, leaving the daughter with Oldest and Boyfriend. No contact for over a month! Oldest and Boyfriend went to a lawyer to see what they could do, and the lawyer said NOTHING. Yep, nothing. A judge in our county won't rule against a mom who has several domestic violence charges called to her home, who has pulled a gun on her current boyfriend several times, has a mental illness, and has had several attempted suicides!

What ought to be acutely troubling is that the history of revisions to oil and gas resources has heretofore been one of increases. For the first time, we are now seeing not just downward revisions in estimated natural gas resources, but drastic downward revisions. That should tell us that the era of unlimited horizons for fossil fuels has come to a close. All the advanced technology that was supposed to bring unending plenty in the form of fossil fuels is now giving us better estimates of what will be available, namely, not nearly so much as we thought.

I really wanted to give the quilter the ability to use their stash but also allow them to go shopping. Who wouldn't want to have some of the newest cutest fabrics in their scrap quilt? It was VERY HARD for me to STOP buying fabric. I kept telling myself, "Ooooh! Wouldn't this be cute? I have to have a bit of this!" I actually used over 150+ fabrics in this quilt. I hope you have fun playing with your stash and adding the newest cutest fabrics to your quilt.

She runs through the doorway and can feel air rushing against her skin as she hurls herself along in long strides. Her bruised breasts and body bounce painfully in opposite directions, the soles of her feet slapping noisily against the darkened floor. Despite the obvious signs of moving closer, somehow the woman seems to be receding from her, as if the distance between them is growing instead of shrinking. A sense of dread and foreboding fill her, and she dares to look over her shoulder, only to find her unhappy attendants chasing after her desperately.

Now that I can feel that sense of "enough" in my body, and I can trust it enough to take action around it, I don't struggle nearly as much with the wants, desires, and wishes that used to plague me. I know what is enough. For most of my life, for most things in my life, I have enough. I am enough. There is enough.

Billy slowly drove into Casey's driveway, and although she had been through a night of fear and terror, she felt nothing other than happiness and joy when she saw her house. It looked like heaven to Casey because she wasn't even sure if she would live to see daylight. Casey slung open the truck door and jumped out of Billy's truck in lightening speed. As she ran up to the driver's side and softly said "I know exactly what happened last night, Billy. You guys drugged me and raped me. And I will never forget it. You're going to get away with it because I am too ashamed to tell anyone what you guys did to me. You can bet your ass that God will avenge my honor. You may not go to jail, but you will suffer for what you did to me." Billy looked at her, and he was completely stunned that she remembered what had happened. This is probably due to, the fact that they gave her what they thought was a drug that would make her forget. Evidently, the effects weren't as potent as Billy had hoped.

Yet let us analyze these implications in their general form. Starting with an increase in extreme weather, the erosion of soils and weak rock will increase. This will cause more of the imposing landmasses to crumble into the sea leading to an even greater rise in sea level. The changes will exponentially become more and more unpredictable. A chaotic patter will emerge which can never be studied. People will panic, but the plain fact is that nature is beyond their control. Sea levels will rise, temperatures will spike, and weather will be out of control. Everything will seem to be pointing toward an inevitable apocalypse.
The verdict? More likely to attract shoppers than Sir Can-A-Lot but a little too futuristic to be relevant in today's economy. Also, without ads it's missing a crucial selling point.

As someone with Type 1 diabetes (the "real" diabetes, as I like to put it -- the kind you can't help getting), I sometimes wonder when I'll end up retiring, or how long I can escape death. So I wonder how much I should be saving for retirement. Will I get the typical 25-30 year long retirement? Or would I have to retire at 40 to pull that one off? If I work until I'm 65, I could have lots put away, only to die within 2 years if I'm lucky, on the other hand.

Then as the conversation wasn't really going to settle anywhere and it was already getting late, I just moved them on to starting to prep the weeks passage. Esther said, we need to talk. So they went into doing personal time with the text and we talked in someone's room. She was visibly distraught and shared her heart that she was upset in the unbelief that had been coming out in our discussion of what to do about large group. At first I was a little taken aback but as she shared her heart and I reflected back on the conversation, I could see that she was right. We had but Jesus back into a box declaring for him what he could/couldnt do in and through our new people hours after having taken him our of the box at fall con. I felt convicted of my own desire to appease people and unbelief of how Jesus could work at UCI. So we came back together with our leaders and Esther shared her heart, her Holy discontent at what had just transpired and it led to a time of repentance from all of our leaders. That would have been cool enough but in the midst of that time, Jesus ministered to the leader I had prayed with at Fall Con by calling out some of the lies he believed about himself being the weak link in the group as we all affirmed him. It was a beautiful moment of the Holy Spirit doing what was on its agenda, not ours. Please pray that we continue to be open to the interruption of the Spirit.

That the lives of these old fellows we see on television, and whose names we now know, go back more than a century, touches us - and it may add to the power they project for us that they are not especially heroic and do not represent themselves that way. That they do not posture or make use of any of the rhetorical cliches, but are modest survivors of the ordinary circumstances and perils of living. And that on television, where glamorisation is almost a given, so that any claim they might once have had to youthful beauty is simply irrelevant. Very young people, I suspect, who find themselves living in a dangerous and chaotic world, and with their own lives fearfully before them, feel a special affection for these old fellows who have indestructibily battled through - and even a small sense of reassurance ...

2. Bring an Abundance of Water and Food on Hikes: The rule of thumb when hiking is: when half of your water supply is gone, start heading back. Last summer I hiked Upper Yosemite Falls, one of the oldest trails in Yosemite, and leads to the highest waterfall in North America at 2,425 ft. It took me 3 hours to hike up and I tried to conserve my water as much as possible but unfortunately I was not able to. Fortunately, when I finally got to the top there was a benevolent man who was filtering water, from the waterfall, to give to weary hikers. Make sure to bring snacks that are high in protein and carbohydrates such as granola bars and nuts because when the hike says strenuous, it means it!

Estevez accomplishes this by embracing the repetitive, ritualized essence of the pilgrimage itself. As lush landscapes and picturesque villages pass by on the screen, scene after scene after scene, the metaphor of life as a journey and a struggle begins to sink past the level of intellect. It's obvious, but it's still true, and when Tom and his motley compatriots reach the end of the road and each delivers a pithy summation, their exhausted satisfaction is contagious.
The conversation lasted no more than five minutes: Pritchett introduced himself, offered his badge and business card, and explained that although he typically focused on national security and terrorism, public corruption and white-collar crime were also Justice Department priorities.

Not necessarily challenges, just different ways to price a menu. It's a more family-oriented market, so we have to be sure we cater to families and children with a kids menu. I have a young daughter, too, so I'm happy when we go out and see a kids menu.
"Monster House" was shot with the same motion-capture process that was used in Mr. Zemeckis's "Polar Express," a process I didn't like then and don't like now, even though advancements have been made in its area of obvious weakness, immobile faces. "Monster House" benefits from strong graphic design and lovely lighting, but the script is nothing to write home about. It focuses on three neighborhood kids, reminiscent of the trio in "Harry Potter," who dare to penetrate the house in an effort to tame it. By the time they've survived a succession of standard-brand terrors done with visual flair, they understand what every homeowner already knows -- a house can eat you alive.

City officials and the visitor's bureau have been trying for decades to create an entertainment area to bring tax dollars and a sense of identity to the city. The closest they came was in the 1990s when a developer planned a Universal Studios-type project next to Great America, though it never came to fruition. They also courted the Oakland A's and San Francisco Giants for new ballparks, to no avail. But the city thinks it's finally reeled in its superstar.

Designers Charlie Groppetti and Todd Smith grew up in the country and have happy memories of their childhood homes and a simpler life. A nostalgic desire for the way things used to be led them in 2006 to start Park Hill Collection, a Little Rock company that designs vintage-inspired objects for your home. Some of their objects, such as salvaged sinks turned into planters, are playful. Others, such as reclaimed wood tables and mirrors, add period charm. Two years ago, the company added candles to its home accessories collection. Hand-poured in Arkansas, the soy-based candles ($22.50) are packaged in willow-wrapped glass -- ready to give. While Southern Charm is a top seller, other favorites include Sweet Tea, Front Porch and Farmhouse.

Blue cheeses must be difficult to perfect or our state's talented cheesemakers would surely make more of them. Sonoma County's Bellwether Farms experimented with the style, but never introduced a blue. No doubt Jones will continue to tweak Big Rock Blue - it's a newbie, after all - but it's impressive now.

This dazzling adaptation of Philip Pullman's fantasy novel proves that Oscar-winning visual effects aren't enough. By playing it safe and cutting the controversial anti-Christian elements, the producers disappointed the novel's fans. The sanitized story about a girl facing grown-up problems in a parallel world with talking animals might have scored with younger audiences, if not for the PG-13 rating. Will young Lyra Belacqua return in the planned sequel, "The Subtle Knife"? "Compass" cost $180 million and made $70 million. Do the math. 113 minutes. A two-disc version has tons of extras.
But alas, there has been no recovery. The one we've been hearing about for a couple of years now has been an illusion fueled by hope and hype. The federal government simply has not been able to print enough money to prime a broken pump. Wrong again, Mr. Keynes.

Shields won again, though he was far from his best. Despite posting a season high for strikeouts, his four walks also were a season high and the right-hander allowed a pair of homers for the second straight start.

Some - mostly those sneering from the outside - maintain that Cleveland fans have created a toxic environment for their teams by constantly bemoaning their fate. That the culture of losing and woe-is-me mentality feed off each other. That Cleveland fans would not know what to do with themselves if one of the major pro teams ever won the whole thing again.
Lobbyists and private contractors profit from this arms race. Hugely expensive projects like nuclear submarines and a new generation of bomber contribute more to defending the bottom line of major contractors than they do to defending America. It is time to move away from a self-perpetuating procurement process that counts national security in dollars -- not sense.

The savings rate was unchanged at 4.9 percent of after-tax incomes, the same as March. Both months represented the smallest savings rate since October 2008, the month the country was plunged into a deep financial crisis which contributed to the worst recession since the 1930s. During the recession, Americans worked to build up savings out of concerns that they needed a deeper cushion in the face of massive job layoffs.

The margin was less than 10 points for only 90 seconds of the third quarter. Stoudemire went to the bench with his fifth foul with 6:41 left in the third, and Miami went on an 11-2 spurt not long after that all but sealed the outcome. It was 67-58 when Fields made two free throws with 4:49 left in the quarter - and then the Heat's "Big Three" needed just 3 minutes to blow the game open.

Secondhand smoke is smoke coming from another person or a burning cigarette (mainstream or side stream). It increases the risk of heart and blood vessel disease. Secondhand smoke is responsible for a large number of smoking-related deaths. The American Heart Association estimates that more than 35,000 nonsmokers die from heart disease caused by other people's tobacco smoke each year. This happens when people are exposed for long periods of time to secondhand smoke in homes or workplaces.
In the play, one of the conspiring reporters works for the Rocky Mountain News, though no evidence exists that the paper played any part in the scheme. But doing so allows Suh to exploit one of the longest newspaper rivalries in history, ending with the News' closure in 2009. You needn't have been alive in 1907 to know how intensely these papers feuded. But that year, Bonfils' enmity for News owner Thomas Patterson spilled out into the streets near the state Capitol. In the spirit of a Wild West duel, Bonfils attacked Patterson, who had called Bonfils a blackmailer in a News cartoon. When the teetering News was bought by Cincinnati media company Scripps-Howard and merged with The Express in 1926, Roy Howard spit, "We believe that a dictatorship of Denver's newspaper field by The Denver Post would be nothing less than a blight."

Our favorite yogurt recipe comes from David Lebovitz's "The Perfect Scoop": In a large bowl, stir together 3 cups Greek-style yogurt and 3/4 cup sugar until sugar is dissolved. You can vary the yogurt fat content, but at least 1 cup of whole-milk yogurt will help the texture. (Find Greek yogurt at Trader Joe's, Costco and Whole Foods Market.) Add a teaspoon of vanilla if you'd like. Omit it if you're after the Pinkberry taste. Chill mixture one hour, then freeze in an ice-cream maker according to your machine's instructions.

Secondhand smoke is smoke coming from another person or a burning cigarette (mainstream or side stream). It increases the risk of heart and blood vessel disease. Secondhand smoke is responsible for a large number of smoking-related deaths.

This happens when people are exposed for long periods of time to secondhand smoke in homes or workplaces.

Designers Charlie Groppetti and Todd Smith grew up in the country and have happy memories of their childhood homes and a simpler life. A nostalgic desire for the way things used to be led them in 2006 to start Park Hill Collection, a Little Rock company that designs vintage-inspired objects for your home. Some of their objects, such as salvaged sinks turned into planters, are playful. Others, such as reclaimed wood tables and mirrors, add period charm. Two years ago, the company added candles to its home accessories collection. Hand-poured in Arkansas, the soy-based candles ($22.50) are packaged in willow-wrapped glass -- ready to give. While Southern Charm is a top seller, other favorites include Sweet Tea, Front Porch and Farmhouse.

Desserts (all $7) provide slightly creative twists on many classics. Panna cotta tastes lightly of orange and comes with a creamy custard thinly spread underneath. It's OK, if a bit dense. When we ordered zabaglione, I expected a frothy, slightly boozy custard, which is usually made with eggs and Marsala, but instead got what tasted like tiramisu filling. It was light, rich and good, especially with the ripe strawberries, but it wasn't zabaglione.

Add a teaspoon of vanilla if you'd like. Omit it if you're after the Pinkberry taste. Chill mixture one hour, then freeze in an ice-cream maker according to your machine's instructions.

Estevez accomplishes this by embracing the repetitive, ritualized essence of the pilgrimage itself.

He could be traded if the right offer comes along and the Cardinals want to pounce on a starting shortstop, for example.

With Matt Holliday and Berkman already in place, the opening for Craig is at first base -- but only if the Cardinals don't re-sign Albert Pujols. Craig's role is in flux.
